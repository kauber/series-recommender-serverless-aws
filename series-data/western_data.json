    "description": "Four Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog.\n\nTex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005.",

McClelland was mostly concerned with right-of-way issues, which could be affected by stubborn landowners, ranchers, Indians, outlaws, and other factors. Helping McClelland with his work was surveyor Billy Kincaid, played by Pratt. Susan Cummings rounded out the cast as Georgia, proprietor of the Golden Nugget Saloon, the rolling bar that followed the railroad workers along the tracks. Union Pacific never developed a following and was cancelled after a single season.\n\nUnion Pacific was filmed by California National Productions at the Iverson's Movie Ranch in Chatsworth in Los Angeles County, California. Other offerings were the syndicated Boots and Saddles and Pony Express and the NBC anthology series, Frontier, which aired from 1955-1956.",

Bonanza creator David Dortort approved PAX TV's decision to hire Beth Sullivan, creator and executive producer of Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman to oversee scripts and executive produce, which some believe gave the series a softer edge. Ponderosa was canceled after one season, in part because of disappointing ratings and high production costs. Although Sullivan had hoped to film the series in and around Los Angeles, PAX decided to film in Australia to reduce costs. Series \"show runner\" Sullivan sustained severe injuries in a car crash only twelve days after the airing of the first season's last episode.\n\nThe show should not be confused with Ponderosa, the title used for Bonanza reruns aired on NBC during the summer of 1972.",

The series was likely based on a true-life personality of the 1930s, Jack Cones, the \"Flying Constable\" of Twentynine Palms in San Bernardino County, California, although this claim is unverified.\n\nAlthough the series had strong western elements, King mostly captured criminals and spies, and found lost hikers with the use of his plane, the Songbird. Though the planes used changed during the course of the series, the later model was not given a number, but was still known as the Songbird.\n\nKing and his niece, Penny, lived on the Flying Crown Ranch, near the town of Grover, Arizona. Penny and Clipper were also pilots, though still relatively inexperienced and looking to their uncle for guidance and mentoring. Penny was an accomplished air racer and rated multi-engine pilot, whom Sky trusted to fly the Songbird. In the third TV episode, Penny refers to Clipper as \"my brother\", so they are siblings.\n\nThe musical score was largely the work of Herschel Burke Gilbert.",

The beginning theme song for the series included the lines: \"Texas John Slaughter made 'em do what they oughta, and if they didn't, they died.\" Tryon later became a novelist.\n\nJohn Vivyan appeared twice on the series in the role of dishonest rancher Jason Hemp and a third time in an uncredited part. Other co-stars were Darryl Hickman and Bing Russell. Chris Alcaide and Judson Pratt appeared as an outlaw and as Colonel Cooper, respectively, in the segment \"Ambush in Laredo\".\n\nThe series appeared in re-runs on the Disney Channel's classic program block \"Disney Drive-In\" which was later known as \"Vault Disney\".",

Frank's real-life wife Susan Blanchard played his girlfriend Nell, while John Dehner appeared as a frontier marshal who had arrested Ben's father Beau decades before. The series was cancelled by CBS after only eight hour-long episodes had been shown, leaving several which were never aired.\n\nThe 1978 TV-movie The New Maverick, featuring Garner as Bret, Frank as Ben, Jack Kelly as Bret's brother Bart Maverick, and Blanchard as Nell, served as the pilot for the series. Garner appeared as Bret Maverick in the very first scene of the series, but only for a few moments. Among the actors appearing on the series were Howard Duff, John McIntire, James Woods, Donna Mills, and Harry Dean Stanton. Roger Moore, who played Beau Maverick in the original series, never appeared in Young Maverick.

In the television series, Gavin played Harrison Destry, son of Tom, who had himself been a lawman until he was framed for a crime and sent to prison. The show followed Harrison Destry upon his release from prison as he wandered the West looking for the people that framed him. Just like the feature films, many comedic situations arose because Destry went to great lengths to avoid violence even though he was always running into trouble.\n\nDestry never caught on with television audiences, especially since the popularity of the Western genre had begun to wane, and the series only lasted for thirteen episodes.\n\nAmong the guest stars were Chris Alcaide, Ron Hayes, Roger Mobley, Stuart Randall, and Barbara Stuart.",

The two most unusual features about the series were the presence of Joel McCrea, a favorite of Western movie audiences for his performance in such films as Union Pacific, Buffalo Bill, and Ramrod, and the fact that his real life son was in Wichita Town, but did not play his son.

The one-hour black-and-white program was offered at 9 p.m. Eastern on Tuesdays opposite NBC's Thriller, hosted by Boris Karloff, and CBS's The Red Skelton Show.\n\nRogers became well-known a dozen years later on M*A*S*H, and Bray later portrayed the forest ranger Corey Stuart on Lassie from 1964\u20131969, both on CBS. Child actor Richard Eyer had starred in a number of films in the 1950s, including Friendly Persuasion and Desperate Hours.\n\nStagecoach West was produced by Dick Powell's Four Star Television. It is believed that the series was cancelled despite the high quality of its production because of the glut of westerns on television at the time that it aired. The same fate had fallen on CBS's Johnny Ringo, a 1959 one-season spin-off of Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater.",

The Rangers apparently had wanted him removed from the service altogether but were prevented from doing so by the fact that his father was their commander. But he seemed to bring his own trouble with him, as crime suddenly returned to a place that had seen very little of it the prior 20 years.\n\nAlso appearing in Rango was the American Indian character Pink Cloud, an overly-assimilated Indian who was very fond of the ways of the whites and whose command of the English language was generally better than theirs.\n\nThe theme song co-written by Earle Hagen and sung by Frankie Laine. The series ran for less than a year.\n\nTV Guide ranked the series number 47 on its TV Guide's 50 Worst Shows of All Time list in 2002.",

The character of Native American U.S. Marshal Sam Buckhart was introduced in two episodes of the popular ABC Western television series The Rifleman starring Chuck Connors as Lucas McCain.\n\nLaw of the Plainsman is distinctive and unique in that it was one of the few television programs that featured a Native American as the lead character, a bold move for U.S.network television at that time. Ansara had earlier appeared in the series Broken Arrow, having portrayed the Apache chief, Cochise. Ansara, however, was not Native American but of Syrian descent.\n\nAnsara played Sam Buckhart, an Apache Indian who saved the life of a U.S. Cavalry officer after an Indian ambush. When the officer died, he left Sam money that was used for an education at private schools and Harvard University. After school, he returned to New Mexico where he became a Deputy Marshal working for Marshal Andy Morrison. He lived in a boarding house run by Martha Commager. The only other continuing character was 8-year old Tess Logan, an orphan who had been rescued by Buckhart. Robert Harland, later of Target: The Corruptors! starred in seven episodes as Deputy Billy Lordan. Wayne Rogers, who went on to star in another Four Star western, Stagecoach West, and later, M*A*S*H, also played deputy Lordan in several episodes.",

    "description": "My Friend Flicka is a 39-episode western television series set at the fictitious Goose Bar Ranch in Wyoming at the turn of the 20th century. The program was filmed in color but initially aired in black and white on CBS at 7:30 p.m. Fridays from February 10, 1956, to February 1, 1957. It was a mid-season replacement for Gene Autry's The Adventures of Champion. Both series, however failed in the ratings against ABC's The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin.\n\nAfter the initial Friday airing, viewers could still find the series on CBS Saturdays at 7 p.m. Eastern during March 1957, on Sundays at 6 p.m. from April to May 1957, and on Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. from June to August 1957. NBC carried the program in color at 6:30 p.m. Sunday from September to December 1957 and at 7 p.m. Sunday from January to May 1958. In subsequent years, the series aired mostly on Saturday mornings on all networks. The Disney Channel ran it on Monday evenings in the mid-1980s. Over the years many viewers were unaware that the series produced episodes for only a single season.\n\nMy Friend Flicka starred native Canadian Johnny Washbrook as Ken McLaughlin, a boy devoted to his horse Flicka, Swedish for \"little girl\", but actually an Arabian sorrel named Wahana. Gene Evans played the authoritarian father Rob McLaughlin, a former U.S. Army cavalry officer. Anita Louise was cast as the gentle-spirited mother, Nell. Frank Ferguson portrayed Gus Broeberg, the loyal ranch hand. Flicka is based on a novel by Mary O'Hara, written at the Remount Ranch, located between Laramie and Cheyenne, Wyoming. Some Internet sites say that the series is set in Montana, where some of the filming was done. The majority of the filming, however, was at Fox Movie Ranch. My Friend Flicka holds the distinction of having been the first television series filmed by 20th Century Fox. A 1943 film, My Friend Flicka, starred Roddy McDowall as Ken.",
