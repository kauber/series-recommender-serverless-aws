    "description": "Tugs is a British children's television series first broadcast in 1988. It was created by the producers of Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends, Robert D. Cardona and David Mitton. The series dealt with the adventures of two anthropomorphized tugboat fleets, the Star Fleet and the Z-Stacks, who compete against each other in the fictional Bigg City Port. The series was set in the Roaring Twenties, and was produced by Tugs Ltd., for TVS and Clearwater Features Ltd. Music was composed by Junior Campbell and Mike O'Donnell, who also wrote the music for Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends.\n\nDue to the bankruptcy of production company TVS, the series did not continue production past 13 episodes. Following the initial airing of the series throughout 1988, television rights were sold to an unknown party, while all models and sets from the series sold to Britt Allcroft. Modified set props and tugboat models were used in Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends from 1991 onwards, with footage from the original program being heavily dubbed and edited for use in American children's series Salty's Lighthouse. Mitton returned to working with Thomas & Friends in 1991, while Cardona would go on to direct Theodore Tugboat, a similarly natured animated series set in Canada. All thirteen episodes of the show were released on VHS between 1988 and 1993.",

    "description": "Jimbo and the Jet Set is a British animated cartoon series broadcast in the 1980s, featuring the adventures of the eponymous Jimbo, a talking aeroplane. Created by Maddocks Cartoon Productions, it originally ran for 25 episodes between 1985 and 1986.\n\nThe premise of the cartoon is that Jimbo was originally intended to be a Jumbo Jet, but his designer could not tell the difference between inches and centimetres, resulting in his diminutive size. If Jimbo's designer switched the imperial measurements of the Boeing 747 for metric, the result would have been an aircraft with a fuselage length of 91 ft; this would make Jimbo roughly the length of an early-series Boeing 737.\n\nThe television series features various talking airport-type ground vehicles: Tommy Tow-Truck, Claude Catering, Amanda Baggage, Phil the Fuel Truck, Sammy Steps and Harry Helicopter. Other plane characters appear from time to time, such as Old Timer, a Vickers Wellington bomber who gets into the story while flying to or from an airshow. The story is based at a fictional \"London Airport\", under the command of an irate controller who frequently ends episodes screaming \"I want words with you, Jimbo!\".",

The plot revolves around both the daily lives and the misadventures of a group of monsters living in a castle. Although the emphasis was on humour and the show was marketed as a children's programme but also for family entertainment, the show drew much from the genres of horror and dark fantasy. The show has since become a cult favourite and remains one of the most widely recognised kids' shows of the 1980s. Digital children's channel Pop started rerunning the show in 2010.",

    "description": "Captain Kangaroo was an American children's television series which aired weekday mornings on the American television network CBS for nearly 30 years, from October 3, 1955 until December 8, 1984, making it the longest-running nationally broadcast children's television program of its day. In 1986, the American Program Service integrated some newly produced segments into reruns of past episodes, distributing the newer version of the series until 1993.\n\nThe show was conceived and the title character played by Bob Keeshan, who based the show on \"the warm relationship between grandparents and children.\" Keeshan had portrayed the original Clarabell the Clown on The Howdy Doody Show when it aired on NBC. Captain Kangaroo had a loose structure, built around life in the \"Treasure House\" where the Captain would tell stories, meet guests, and indulge in silly stunts with regular characters, both humans and puppets.\n\nThe show was telecast live to the East Coast and the Midwest for its first four years and broadcast on kinescope for the West Coast, as Keeshan would not perform the show live three times a day, and was in black-and-white until 1966. The May 17, 1971 episode saw two major changes on the show: The Treasure House was renovated and renamed \"The Captain's Place\" and the Captain replaced his navy blue coat with a red coat. In September 1981, CBS shortened the hour-long show to a half-hour, briefly retitled it Wake Up with the Captain, and moved it to an earlier time slot; it was later moved to weekends in September 1982, and returned to an hour-long format. It was canceled by CBS at the end of 1984.",

It first aired in syndication from September 17, 1987 and ended on May 25, 1991.\n\nDuring its first season, the series was originally part of NBC's Prime Time Begins at 7:30 campaign, in which the network's owned-and-operated stations would run first-run sitcoms in the 7:30-8 pm time slot to counterprogram competing stations' game shows, sitcom reruns and other offerings. Out of This World was rotated with the original series Marblehead Manor and She's the Sheriff, a syndicated revival of the 1983 sitcom We Got It Made, and a television adaptation of the play You Can't Take It With You. NBC ended the experiment after the 1987-88 season due to the low ratings put up by three of the series, with Out of This World being one of the two that was renewed. After its first season the series was largely moved to weekend time slots, where it remained until its cancellation following the fourth season.",

Anne Wood also created the children's show Teletubbies, and Boohbah is produced by the UK's Ragdoll Ltd. and the USA's PBS Kids. The similarity between this show and Teletubbies, both of which have a \"science fiction\" theme, is notable. One of the show's trademarks is a child's voice pronouncing the show's name in sing-song.\n\n\"Boohbah\" means \"doll\" in Hebrew, but it is not clear if this influenced the name of the show, or even if the creators are aware of this.",

They wore insect-themed outfits with antennae and wings which allowed them to fly, though on occasion, they were shown flying on surfboards. They were constantly beset by the evil machinations of Benita Bizarre, played by comedienne Martha Raye. Bizarre, being untalented and ugly herself, was covetous of the Bugaloos' musical prowess.",

    "description": "Cartoon Planet is an animated variety show that originally ran from 1995 to 1998, and from March 30, 2012 to present on Cartoon Network. A spin-off of the animated Space Ghost Coast to Coast talk show, the original premise was that Space Ghost had recruited his imprisoned evil arch nemesis Zorak and his loud and extremely dimwitted archenemy Brak to assist him in hosting a variety show.\n\nCartoon Planet began as an hour-long block of cartoons hosted by Space Ghost, Zorak, and Brak. They would introduce full cartoons from the Turner Entertainment library, such as old theatrical shorts and Hanna-Barbera cartoons, including the original 1960s Space Ghost episodes. The host segments were often original songs and ad libbed skits. New material ceased being made in 1997, and most of the songs and skits were re-packaged into 22 half-hour episodes without cartoons.",

The series was originally broadcast between 1964 and 1971 on ORTF, originally in black-and-white.\n\nHaving originally rejected the series as \"charming... but difficult to dub into English\", the BBC later produced a version of the series using the original stop motion animation footage with new English-language scripts, written and performed by Eric Thompson, which bore little relation to the original storylines. This version, broadcast in 441 five-minute-long episodes from 18 October 1965 to 25 January 1977, was a great success and attained cult status, and when in 1967 it was moved from the slot just before the evening news to an earlier children's viewing time, adult viewers complained to the BBC.",

It was also influenced by Star Trek, Super Sentai, Voltron, and Star Wars. The show also contains various references to pop culture, a notable example being the episode \"Season of the Skull\", which is a parody of the 1970s thriller The Wicker Man.",

He then wondered what stories these shoes could tell about themselves when they were new and when they had gradually worn out.\n\nThe theme song for The Shoe People was written and sung by Justin Hayward of The Moody Blues.\n\nA second series titled 'The New Adventures of The Shoe People' consisting of 26 episodes was commissioned using a number of new characters, however there is little known information as to how the episodes became in the public domain.",

In 1972, the show was re-conceptualized as Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, sixteen episodes of which aired on CBS during the 1972-73 season and were rerun the following season. Reruns of the original series alternated between CBS, ABC, and NBC from 1974 through 1976. This brought its national Saturday morning TV run on three networks to six years.\n\nJosie and the Pussycats featured an all-girl pop music band that toured the world with their entourage, getting mixed up in strange adventures, spy capers, and mysteries. On the small-screen, the group consisted of level-headed lead singer and guitarist Josie, intelligent tambourinist Valerie, and air-headed blonde drummer Melody. Other characters included their cowardly manager Alexander Cabot III, his conniving sister Alexandra, her cat Sebastian, and muscular roadie Alan.",

There are also sound checks, gags, and \"real-life\" portions of the show.\n\nGerald still only makes sounds, but he now has two speaking friends, Janine and Jacob, as well as a dog named Burp, who only burps. Gerald's parents also fill out the regular cast. The television series was produced in Canada by Cookie Jar Entertainment, and directed by Robin Budd and story edited/written by John Derevlany. The animation was done by Mercury Filmworks in Ottawa & Vancouver. The music and score for the series was composed by Ray Parker and Tom Szczesniak.\n\nIt is shown on ABC TV in Australia, Channel 5's Milkshake! in the UK and RTE Two's The Den in Ireland",

The format of a programme generally includes a visit to the caf\u00e9 by a nursery rhyme or fairy tale character. Little Cook tells a story about the visitor in which he\u2019s the real hero, and then they decide to cook the visitor a meal from Big Cook's recipe book. Little Cook will then fly away on his magic spoon to see where one of the ingredients is made. Activities within the kitchen, such as washing up and tidying up, are accompanied by catchy song and dance routines. Both cooks act in a way to encourage children to take an interest in cooking. Big Cook does most of the cooking and tells the viewers how to make the recipes; Little Cook does some preparation or sets the timer.",

It follows the trails and exploits of a South Korean girl named Pucca who is insanely in love with a prideful ninja named Garu. Meanwhile, Garu and Pucca help their town of Sooga Village out when evil ninjas attack, as well as diffuse a lot of the absurd situations that frequently plague the town. This show could best be described as a cleaned-up version of South Park meets Looney Tunes meets Naruto. There is some very subtly hidden adult humor; but most of the adult jokes would not go noticed by small children, who are the primary audience.",

Jackanory continued to be broadcast until 1996, clocking up around 3,500 episodes in its 30-year run. The final story, The House at Pooh Corner by A. A. Milne, was read by Alan Bennett and broadcast on 24 March 1996. The show returned on 27 November 2006 for two one-off stories.\n\nThe show's format, which varied little over the decades, involved an actor reading from children's novels or folk tales, usually while seated in an armchair. From time to time the scene being read would be illustrated by a specially commissioned still drawing, often by Quentin Blake. Usually a single book would occupy five daily fifteen-minute episodes, from Monday to Friday.",

Every episode always starts with and finishes with the phrase: \"This is a true story, and it happened to a friend of a friend of mine.\" and by the words of Larry, \"Just because they never happened, doesn't mean they ain't true.\" Animation styles and musical scoring varied within each half-hour episode, incorporating 20 different looks in the first season alone. The short stories and changing styles were specifically designed to keep viewers' attention span.",

Originally a sporadic series airing on Saturday mornings, Sunday afternoons, or weekday afternoons during the summer from 1967, it became a regularly scheduled program in 1971 on the CBS Saturday morning lineup, running one hour with some films apparently edited down to fit the time slot. The program was hosted by 1950s television act Kukla, Fran and Ollie, aka puppeteer Burr Tillstrom and actress Fran Allison.\n\nKukla, Fran and Ollie were dropped from the series in 1977 and the program was renamed CBS Saturday Film Festival. In 1978 CBS canceled the show in favor of the youth targeted magazine 30 Minutes which was modeled after its adult sister show 60 Minutes. CBS canceled 30 Minutes in 1982 and brought back Saturday Film Festival which ran for two seasons until CBS cancelled it for good in 1984.\n\nPerhaps the most famous \"episode\" of the series was the 1960 British film Hand in Hand, the story of a deep friendship between two elementary school students, one a Roman Catholic boy and the other a Jewish girl.\n\nIn addition to many American and British films, the series also featured motion pictures from Russia, France, Bulgaria, Japan, Sweden, Italy, China, Australia, South Africa, and Czechoslovakia as well as several other countries.",

The fairy tale was usually altered for comedic effect in a manner relational to Fractured Fairy Tales.\n\nEach story typically spoofs a film genre, such as the \"Cinderella\" episode done as an Elvis movie. Some episodes featured a \"fourth wall\" effect where ALF is backstage preparing for the episode, and Rob Cowan would appear drawn as a TV executive to try to brief ALF on how to improve this episode. For instance Cowan once told ALF who was readying for a medieval themed episode that \"less than 2% of our audience lives in the Dark Ages\".",

The programme was set \u2013 as the title suggests \u2013 in Ward B1, the children's ward of the fictitious South Park Hospital, and told the stories of the young patients and the staff present there. Aimed at older children and teenagers, Children's Ward was a long-lived series for a children's drama, starting life in 1988 as a contribution to the Dramarama anthology strand, \"Blackbird Singing In The Dead of Night\", then first broadcast as a series 1989 and running from then until 2000.\n\nThe series was conceived by Granada staff writers Paul Abbott and Kay Mellor, both of whom went on to enjoy successful careers as award-winning writers of adult television drama. At the time, they were both working on the soap opera Coronation Street, and had recently collaborated on a script for Dramarama.\n\nAbbott, who had been through a troubled childhood himself, had initially wanted to set the series in a children's care home rather than a hospital, but this was vetoed by Granada executives. During the course of its run, however, Children's Ward won many plaudits for covering difficult issues such as cancer, alcoholism, drug addiction and child abuse in a sensitive manner. The programme won many awards, including in 1996 a BAFTA Children's Award for Best Drama, won by an episode in which a serial killer lures children to him via the internet and is \u2013 highly unusually for children's television \u2013 not eventually caught.",

Alongside the original cast of Lamb Chop, Hush Puppy, Charlie Horse, and Shari, Charlie Horse Music Pizza introduced four new characters \u2013 Take-Out, a big anthropomorphized orangutan who makes deliveries on roller skates; Fingers, a giant purple raccoon that lives in the dumpster behind the pizzeria; Cookie the soft-hearted, opera-loving cook; and Junior, who works at the pizzeria part-time, and plays musical instruments, such as the tuba for his high school marching band.\n\nThe series was put on hiatus after the May 30 episode aired due to Lewis' treatment in a local hospital. It was then cancelled when she died on August 2.",

Usually the protagonist is a boy or girl who starts by trying to do something normal and ordinary, ending up facing an alien, supernatural or weird force of some kind. This is both a fantasy and science fiction show, with aliens, portals and time travel. Often it has a low level horror aspect as well, as in ghost visitations. It is comparable to a children's version of The Twilight Zone. It is set in New Zealand in ordinary locations such as houses, malls and schools.\n\nMost of the episodes have one word in their titles. Some episodes show real-life companies; for example, Allens Lollies and Fantastic Noodles are in the \"Trolley\" episode, and the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets game is in the \"Mirror\" episode.\n\nIt aired originally in 2003 in New Zealand, and subsequently on the ABC network in Australia.",

Based on a series of children's books by Andrea Beck, its 104 episodes show the adventures of a young moose named Elliot who lives in a place called \"The Big House\", and shares adventures while having lots of fun with his friends; Beaverton, Lionel, Socks, and Paisley. The series was produced by Nelvana, then later on Corus Entertainment.\n\nThe series was developed by Jed MacKay and produced by Marianne Culbert. The series was unique in that half of the stories were animated, and half were live action; reflecting children's real world of play and their imaginary world. The music was composed by Bruce Ley and Jed MacKay.",

They are based on W\u0142adys\u0142aw Nehrebecki's sons, named Jan and Roman, and were partially created by German-born Alfred Ledwig before being developed by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Nehrebecki and Leszek Lorek. The series is about two young brothers and their fun and sometimes silly adventures which often involve spending a lot of time outdoors. They first appeared in an animated film in 1963.\n\nThe names of the two characters are diminutives of Boles\u0142aw and Karol. In English, the cartoon was distributed as Jym & Jam and Bennie and Lennie. Some episodes were seen as part of Nickelodeon's Pinwheel. In 1973 the creators of the film placed on the request from the female viewing audience a girl character by the name of Tola. The first time she appeared in occurred in the episode entitled \"Tola\". In total, Tola appeared in 30 episodes.\n\nMost episodes do not have dialogues. Exceptions are feature-length films and the series from the 1980s, where the main characters' voices were done by: Bolek \u2013 Ewa Z\u0142otowska, Ilona Ku\u015bmierska; Lolek \u2013 Danuta Mancewicz, Danuta Przesmycka.\n\nDuring the period of the Peoples Republic of Poland, Bolek and Lolek were reproduced in a large quantity of toys: action figures, movies, postcards, online arcades, puzzles, etc., which can be seen in the Museum of Dobranocki of the PRL. They are also currently made in computer programs, coloring books, general picture books and games.",

The series was about anthropomorphic automobiles that bore resemblances to cats and dogs. The main characters are freedom fighters trying to save their homeworld of Autopia from The Crusher. The show ran for two seasons, each consisting of 26 ten-minute episodes.\n\nHot Rod is a bright red animal hybrid. He's part car, part canine, and he's just one of a collection of dog-cars and cat-cars found on the anthropomorphic automotive world of Autopia. And this place would be something of a car utopia, if it wasn't for the fact that Hot Rod has fallen foul of the Autopia police force, who come in the bulldogged shape of the Gridlockers. He's also caught the eye of the all-powerful, megalomaniac machine known as the Crusher, who has a variety of bounty hunters and mean machines at his disposal. And that's our cue for lots of freewheelin' action as Hot Rod and his miss-matched pals in the resistance attempt to dodge the constabulary and tackle the bad guys head-on in a bid to rid the land of tyranny for ever!",

Every episode has one viewer's photograph superimposed on a cartoon body. These characters then roam around the story, walking, running, jumping, and physically interacting with the main cartoon characters. The viewer characters never speak, and the other characters do not refer to them by name. Instead, they are referred to as \"Little Boy\" or \"Little Girl\" as is relevant.\n\nSince the start of 2007, many new episodes of Pic Me have involved two viewers, instead of just one. These \"best friends\" type episodes have the main star viewer holding, or looking at, a picture of their real-life \"best friend\". Another episode starring the \"best friend\" is shown at a later date, with the situation regarding the pictures reversed.\n\nSince mid-2008, episodes of Pic Me have begun to air in the United States on PBS KIDS Sprout.\n\nAlso, in the United States a Spanish-dubbed version airs on V-Me.",

This anime is based on the 1902 novel Five Children and It by English author Edith Nesbit.\n\nThe anime differs from the novel in revolving around four children rather than five. Three of the children are siblings while the fourth is their friend and neighbor. The four children encounter the Psammead who, in the anime, is depicted as being yellow with a blue hat, and more of a grumpy and lazy being than mischievous.\n\nIn Latin America, the series was known as Samed, el duende m\u00e1gico and in France and Quebec as Sablotin. In the Arab world, it was known as Moghamarat Samid.",

Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Cushing, Jeremy Brett, Robert Downey Jnr, Basil Rathbone and Tom Baker to name but a handful. However, there's one name amongst these actors which truly stands out as a superstar. That's right, Roland Rat even tried his hand at the role in Tales of the Rodent Sherlock Holmes. What's in Sherlock's Casebook? Dr Watson (Kevin the Gerbil) keeps a nice diary of all his cases with Sherlock Holmes (Roland Rat), but it's not just packed with stories about hounds and studies in pink. No, sir! In fact, there's a whole range of cases which only get the briefest of mentions. However, these adventures see our favourite Baker Street duo taking on such startling cases as chasing a dastardly canary trainers, investigating a mysterious, empty box and even trailing the fiendish Blue Carbuncle! Popping up along the way to thwart Holmes and Watson are a selection of British TV treasures including Mollie Sugden, Barbara Windsor, Rodney Bewes and Christopher Ryan.",

The segment was developed out of a series of workshops that studied the changes in the viewing habits of their audience, and the reasons for the show's lower ratings. \"Elmo's World\" used traditional elements of production, but had a more sustained narrative. It was presented from the perspective of a three-year old child as represented by its host, the Muppet Elmo, who was performed by Kevin Clash. In 2002, Sesame Street's producers changed the rest of the show to reflect its younger demographic and the increase in their viewers' sophistication.",

It tells the story of a Christian leader and his family's adventures living in Ancient Rome, Italy whose mission is to keep Jesus's stories alive during the 1st century. The series consists of thirteen episodes, and features two full-length movies that are compilations of the last four episodes. The introduction to each episode before the opening credits is as follows:\n\n\"Rome, 64 AD. The Emperor Nero has unleashed his fury against the Christians. Their crime: Proclaiming a King higher than Caesar. Setting fire to the city, Nero places the blame on the Christians, and launches a new campaign to wipe them out. Families are separated, children left homeless, as thousands are sold into slavery or thrown to the lions. Escaping the panic of the fire, and dodging the advancing soldiers, a group of children find shelter in the gentle care of Ben and Helena; a local baker, and his wife.

Murphy of Meomi Design Inc.\n\nThe Octonauts follows an underwater exploring crew made up of stylized anthropomorphic animals, a team of eight adventurers who live in an undersea base, the Octopod, from where they go on undersea adventures with the help of a fleet of aquatic vehicles.\n\nThe subject matter is reminiscent of Star Trek and Thunderbirds blended with Jacques Cousteau. Although it is science fiction as regards its technology, the exotic creatures and locations that the crew encounter are real marine animals in their natural habitats.",

When she senses someone needs help, she uses the \"Teleportation Gun\" (a heart-shaped brooch Takahata designs) and transports herself there. Mami's teleportation is only triggered when a projectile is flying toward her, and this locket that shoots out tiny marbles is a portable gadget for teleporting in a controlled way, rather than by chance. Her telekinesis can be precise to a cellular level, which enables her to transport cancerous cells out of one of her father's art critics.

In a bid to raise their social status, their servant, a robotic cat named Doraemon, decides to travel back in time and guide Nobita on the proper path to fortune. Unfortunately Doraemon, a dysfunctional robot that the familly acquired by accident (but chose to keep nonetheless), isn't much better off than Nobita. The robot leads Nobita on many adventures, and while Nobita's life certainly is more exciting with the robot cat from the future, it is questionable if it is in fact better in the way that Doraemon planned.",

It first aired on 4 July 2011.\n\nThe show features a child narrator and all ten children are depicted in real life, although Baby Jake is given a multi-angle photographic face on an animated body. Jake's babbling is translated by his 5-year-old brother Isaac. Isaac is voiced by a real-life 5-year-old boy, in a move described by the Guardian as \"a risk\" since the majority of successful children's television is narrated by adults. The roles of Jake and Isaac are portrayed by real-life brothers Adamo and Franco Bertacchi-Morroni respectively, with Kaizer Akhtar providing the voice of Isaac.",

The Ravenburgse Post is in fact a cover for the organization Mailbox X '. People with problems can write a letter to Postbus X (PO Box X, actually 10) Ravenburg and then possibly helped. The team includes Jonathan Hiks (and later Ilse Hiks), Bodo and later Waldo of \"Het Melkhuisje\" (a caf\u00e9 in the same building), Pol and Jessie. The meetings always go by at Het Melkhuisje, which is connected with the Office of Hiks with a hidden elevator . The rest of the editorial staff doesn't know anything of the activities of Postbus X, which sometimes leads to difficulties, especially when it comes to the clumsy and lazy worker 'De Vergulden Veder' Felix Haentjes, who is however, in favor of state editor Miss Pluym.",

Max is a real cat: fat, fluffy, yellow and constantly pampered by his doting owner Betty.\n\nWhen Gark crashes his spaceship into Betty\u2019s laundry room, he finds a new home and forms an unconventional friendship with Max, who quickly learns how to take advantage of Gark\u2019s mysterious alien powers and his sweet, trusting nature. Max loves having an admirer who will do anything for him, but Gark\u2019s extreme curiosity and lack of understanding about life on Earth push Max out of his comfort zone and into ridiculous hair-raising adventures. Whether they are just hanging out at home or zipping through space and exploring new planets, Gark\u2019s adventurous instincts will force Max to become the hero Gark believes him to be.",

    "description": "Children\u2019s series in which rabbit Haas Das brings the daily news from the animal kingdom. He is assisted (or hampered) by Piet Muis, the rather neurotic mouse who brings in the late bulletins and reads the weather. Haas Das was known for his sense of style: every week he sported a new tie, and as the series became more popular, viewers would send him ties to wear. (His name translates to \"Hare Tie\"). The newsworthy characters from Diereland (\"animal land\") included Koning Leeu, king of Diereland; Skillie Skilpad, chairman of the sportsclub; Stinkie Muishond; the meddling, bellyaching Moeder Raaf; wrestling champ Die Gemaskerde Wonder; Grootoom Flapoor, the old elephant in charge of the cr\u00e8che; and Dokter Karools Krap, the golf-loving, pill-peddling local doctor. Haas Das and Piet Muis were puppet characters, and the news stories were presented in animation.\n\nHaas Das se Nuuskas was the first series to be shown on the opening night of SABC TV on 5 January 1976. Soon it became one of South Africa\u2019s most popular programmes, not just among its intended audience, but especially with adults, due to the humour and social and political satire. Indeed, newspaper cartoons often commented on the series' popularity and how even church and political leaders had become engrossed. Haas Das se Nuuskas was created by Louise Smit, who was behind many of South Africa's most beloved children's series such as Wielie Walie, Pieriewierepark, Mina Moo en Kie, Pumpkin Patch and Kideo.",

After a major sucky school day he makes things worse by hopping on his skateboard and crashing into Theo's garage-lab. Chemicals mix, sparks fly and 17 scientific experiments mash into one freaky mess. The results: Luc and Theo find themselves caught in an irreversible time-loop. This would be a problem if the boys weren't having so much fun! Looped is every kid's dream. Theo and Luc may be stuck in a time-loop but their options are limitless. This provides them with only one over-riding challenge: How much fun can two kids squeeze into one Monday?",

After the piglet regained his health by eating Karin's apple, he revealed that he is a prince, Tonrariano III, from a planet called Booringo. Tonrariano wanted to reward Karin for helping him and so he transformed her into a pig with superpowers. Karin was not at all pleased with the gift because she wanted to become a pretty superheroine like \"Cutey Chao\" (a parody of Cutey Honey), not Super Pig. Reluctantly, she became more interested in her role as Super Pig when she found out that she can turn into someone like \"Cutey Chao\" if she can collect 108 pearls through doing good deeds for other people.",

After making his way inside the home, Grizzy takes advantage of all the modern conveniences there, including a comfortable sofa, air conditioning and fully equipped kitchen. He's not alone, though, because a group of small creatures called lemmings also populate the ranger's house when he is away. Because Grizzy and the lemmings are not civilized enough to live together in peace, it becomes an atmosphere of madness when the two sides try to outdo each other with tricks.",

    "description": "A poor mistake of one genius mother in her science lab places a perfectly normal family in a situation where the three children must now live under one roof with two more teenagers \u2013 their PARENTS. Until they\u2019re able to fix what went wrong, they must live together in the same house, and keep the whole thing a secret from the world. Worst of all, the parents must join their teenaged-twins\u2019 class in high school \u2013 pretending to be their cousins.\n\nHow does it feel to go to school WITH your parents? How does it feel when the hottest boy in class falls in love with your MOTHER instead of falling for you? And how did it happen that your DAD now has more friends on FACEBOOK than you?  Will the kids and parents of the Gillman family learn new things about each other, about family and perceptions, before they change back to being normal?",

It was created and licensed by 4Kids Entertainment.\n\nThe show, while featuring real martial arts by trained martial artists, depicted a fantasy setting using fictional episodic stories, with each episode relating a life lesson. Battles were fought on elaborate closed sets, with an omniscient narrator, on-screen scoring and health gauges, giving the show a feel of a cinematic live-action video game.\n\nWMAC stands for the fictional World Martial Arts Council, where the best martial artists compete for the ultimate prize, the Dragon Star. The Dragon Star is a gold trophy that looks like a shuriken surrounded by a dragon; it was proof that its holder was the best martial artist in the world.",

The children leave the stuffy confines of the city and come to Neverland in the forest, where there is plenty of green space to run around in and lots of eco-friendly food to eat. They will show the viewers how they learn to cooperate with their friends and grow through healthy competition.

When the siblings realize their parents' mission is in jeopardy, they form a secret task force called THE SPYDERS in order to help them out. Tommy, 12, a cute, irresistible goofball; Nikki, 15, a well-meaning but impetuous leader, and Daniel, 16, a sedentary, anxiety-ridden computer nerd, use their brains, charm, audacity and unbridled enthusiasm to outwit and outsmart the villain, who has so far eluded their parents. Will the untrained, blundering Spyders succeed where mom and dad failed?",

One day, her favorite mirror which was given to Akko by her mother is broken, and she prefers to bury it in her yard rather than throw it to the trash can. In her dreams, she is contacted by a spirit (or in some cases the Queen of the Mirror Kingdom) who is touched that the girl would treat the mirror so respectfully and not simply throw it away. Akko-chan is then given the gift of a magical mirror and taught enchantments, such as \"Tekumaku mayakon, tekumaku mayakon\" and \"Lamipasu lamipasu lu lu lu lu lu\", that will allow her to transform into anything she wishes",

The following night however, Ted is accidentally replaced with the head of the evil Junkman, who can now harness the power of the Torso 9000 and manages to break free from the Crash Test facility.[3]\n\nPlotting to destroy the crash dummies, the Junkman sets up his base near an abandoned scrap heap and creates an army of killing machines out of spare car parts. When a valuable disc of information on the Torso 9000 is stolen, and finally Dr. Zub himself is kidnapped, heroes Slick & Spin step in to save the day.",

    "description": "65 million years ago, the knights of the Ryusoul Tribe were selected to participate in a war campaign against the dictating Druidon Tribe who sought to rule Earth. But the Druidon's war campaign was halted by the meteor that brought the age of the dinosaurs to an end, forcing them to flee into space. Meanwhile, the Kishiryu were placed in a deep sleep as a failsafe should the Druidon return. The chosen knights choose to live in peace while passing their mantle down across generations. In the present day, the Druidon return to reclaim Earth as the current generation of knights, the Ryusoulgers, battle them with the support of Ui Tatsui and her father Naohisa Tatsui.",

The juke box came to life...a joking, fun loving, extrovert in a world not quite ready for him. Clyde and the kids work out of Alberto's Diner, in the heartland of North America. Clyde would always send the kids into computer systems...who often faced off against the bugs...and helped solve everything from nuclear disasters to why the competing diners were selling more hamburgers.

    "description": "The year is 2661 CE. Ten years ago, Bashin Dan became the trigger that stopped the Earth from resetting itself. On the anniversary of this sacrifice, Barone and Clackey hold a conference, celebrating the union of Mazoku and humanity, and also Dan's feats.\n\nHowever, beneath that peace, an organization named Cardinal Sign advocates for the subjugation of Mazoku and human supremacy. They resort to terrorist attacks, violence, and have somehow obtained the 12 Zodiac X-Rares which ought to have vanished together with Dan.\n\nAmidst all this chaos, the bearers of the core's light feel a weird sensation, one that they've felt before. What could be the meaning of it, and what is the meaning behind the card that appeared within their decks, named \"The Clash King's Miracle\"?",

Each team has their own issues that they solve, and each yo-yo has a name that reflects the toy's design. The show makes use of minor special effects in order to portray the \"magic\" and the speed of the yo-yo. These magic spells are 'battling' and the person whose magic remains wins.\n\nSome of the yo-yo tricks are common, like the Forward Pass, Loop-the-Loop, Three-Leaf-Clover, Trapeze, Double or Nothing, Gravity Pull, etc. The show also has some tricks of its own created by the producers (most of the tricks are for professionals) like the White Buddha, Buddha's Revenge and the Cold Fusion (hardest trick of Season One).",

However, the new form of government does not work as Tinka had hoped, and she has therefore begun to doubt her abilities as the leader of the elves. When Ingi puts Tinka on the trail of a family secret, she and Lasse search for answers in the human world, and here Tinka awaits a surprise that puts the entire existence of the Kingdom of the Elves at risk.",

In \"Elf Dream Ye Luoli\", the light fairy Bai Guangying and the thunder and lightning master Pang Zun once concluded a contract. For Thunder Lord Pang Zun, the light power of Fairy Light is his strongest source of power. The power of natural light is pure and endless, and the combination of light and electricity is a match made in heaven.

When Aslan woke up from his fainting spell, he was shocked to see a girl with a blue body all over her.  Aslan hit him with a rock.  Unexpectedly, the girl shed tears on the wounds on Aslan's body.

Unlike the older series, which were short and cute episodes, this is an educational TV series that targets both the children and their parents. The animation works together with real actors in teaching children from age two to six about words, simple math, shapes, colors and foreign languages like Chinese & Japanese. The series offers an entertaining way for children to learn about social interaction and behavior while following the adventures of Hello Kitty. Hello Kitty establishes a new image, giving children more things to learn from, rather than just being sweet and cute.",

The puppets were given multiple facial expressions and the sets and props were made based on detailed designs by Studio Vandersteen. Lambik always acts as narrator. A striking difference with the comics is that Jerom's doll now has its eyes open.",
