As it evolved, it turned its focus to stories with gothic intrigue that included themes such as forbidden love, vampires, and life after death. It also abandoned the basic open-ended writing style used on all other daytime dramas in December 2000, instead creating thirteen-week story arcs. This type of storytelling is a staple of Latin telenovelas. It also allowed the cast, crew, and writing staff to only work six months out of the year.",

It was unprecedented in daytime television when ghosts were introduced about six months after it began.\n\nThe series became hugely popular when vampire Barnabas Collins appeared a year into its run. Dark Shadows also featured werewolves, zombies, man-made monsters, witches, warlocks, time travel, and a parallel universe. A small company of actors each played many roles; indeed, as actors came and went, some characters were played by more than one actor. Major writers besides Art Wallace included Malcolm Marmorstein, Sam Hall, Gordon Russell, and Violet Welles.",

It followed two families; the Thompsons, based in Cheshire, England, and the Stevens, living in Sydney, Australia. It was produced and recorded at Studio 6 at Granada Studios in Manchester.\n\nThe link in the storyline was businessman Mike Thompson, who walked out on his family on his birthday and flew to Australia to be with his true love Diana Stevens, whom he had left years earlier. Unbeknownst to Mike, Diana had given birth to his son Andrew and as complications ensued over the abrupt life changes for both families, Andrew travelled to England, where he met Mike\u2019s daughter, Amanda, by his English wife Sue, and they fell in love, not realising that they were half-brother and sister. This plot line was somewhat similar to the opening storyline of the popular Australian soap opera Sons and Daughters which had successfully aired on ITV daytime since 1983.\n\nIt was broadcast twice a week at 3.20pm with the first episode broadcast on 23 April 1990. Both episodes were also repeated on Thursday 10.40pm in the Granada TV region as part of Granada's \"10.40-extra\" strand. After two years, stories involving the Thompson and Stevens families\u2014and the UK-Australian crossover angle\u2014had run their course, with several characters either dead or left for pastures new. In their place came the wealthy Bannerman family, who were introduced during the summer of 1992, as they moved into the Thompsons' Cheshire mansion from a suburb of Manchester. In addition, some of the remaining Australian-based characters were re-located to England.",

    "description": "A Country Practice was an Australian television drama series. At its inception, one of the longest-running of its kind, produced by James Davern of JNP Productions, who had wrote the pilot episode and entered a script contest for the network in 1979, coming third and winning a merit award. It ran on the Seven Network for 1,058 episodes from 18 November 1981 to 22 November 1993. It was produced in ATN-7's production facility at Epping, Sydney. After its lengthy run on the seven network it was picked up by network ten with a mainly new cast from April to November 1994 for 30 episodes, although the ten series was not as successful as its predecessor . The Channel Seven series was also filmed on location in Pitt Town, while, the Channel Ten series was filmed on location in Emerald, Victoria.",

The Colbys revolved around another wealthy, upper-class family, who were distant relatives of the Carringtons of Dynasty and who owned a large multi-national corporation. Intended to surpass its predecessor in opulence, the series' producers were handed an immensely high budget for the era and cast a handful of well-known movie stars among its leads, including Charlton Heston, Barbara Stanwyck, Katharine Ross and Ricardo Montalban. However, The Colbys was ultimately a ratings disappointment, and was canceled after two seasons.",

A co-production between the BBC and independent production company Cinema Verity, Eldorado aired three times a week in a high-profile evening slot on the mainstream channel BBC1, filling the slot vacated by Terry Wogan's chat show Wogan, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7.00pm.\n\nIn spite of a high-profile advertising campaign on television, radio and in the press preceding the launch, the programme was not initially a popular hit with viewers and critics. Ratings improved with a radical overhaul, but it was eventually cancelled by the new controller of BBC1, Alan Yentob.",

Widowed and with three children, she is forced to fight for her family and leaves for the paradisiacal beach town of Maramores, where her mother Zoroastra lives. Parallel to the difficulties, L\u00edvia discovers that she is involved in the eternal struggle of Good against Evil.\n\nIn fact, L\u00edvia is the reincarnation of Princess Cec\u00edlia, the eternal passion of the vampire B\u00f3ris Vladescu, who has been pursuing her for centuries. The two met in 7th century Europe, when B\u00f3ris disputed the princess's love with Count Rog\u00e9rio. Nowadays, Rog\u00e9rio was Beto, L\u00edvia's husband, and the two times he faced Boris, his arch-enemy, he took the worst.\n\nBoris is in Maramores to get Cecilia, his immortal beloved. Or rather, Livia, who raises the boy Zeca, who she doesn't even suspect is actually a half-vampire, son of Boris. The vampire is willing to prepare his son to take his place, but Zeca is reluctant to accept his condition, much to his father's despair.\n\nWith B\u00f3ris comes a legion of vampires willing to terrorize the residents of the peaceful city. Among them, the splendid Mina, his wife, and the gallant Victor, who involves the sweet Ci\u00e7a in a game of seduction. Vampires are closely watched by the flustered Galileo Van Burger, a vampire hunter who failed to prevent his wacky son Bart\u00f4 from being bitten.\n\nWho also keeps an eye on the vampires is the mystical Zoroastra, mother of L\u00edvia, a modern witch, who owns the main inn in Maramores. And the mysterious Ezekiel, in reality an angel who came down to Earth to protect L\u00edvia and Zeca from the evil that persecutes them.\n\nEngineer Rodrigo also arrives in the city, followed by his ex-girlfriend Lara. The two are the first victims of vampires. Lara is bitten by Victor and becomes an evil vampire, due to her bad temper. Rodrigo is bitten by Mina, who becomes pregnant and is expecting a daughter from him, which she says is from Boris.\n\nMeanwhile, Rodrigo is used by Boris to approach L\u00edvia. Who does not like this involvement is Augusto, a friend of L\u00edvia who has loved her in the past. Augusto is a widower who raises his small children with the help of sister-in-law Marta, a blind woman, but bitter and Machiavellian, who does everything to keep him from L\u00edvia, because she loves him.",

It told the story of the average middle-class Taylor family whose lives are transformed by winning $3 million in the lottery. The series was broadcast by the Nine Network, initially as two one-hour episodes each week.\n\nPrincipal cast members included John Sheerin and Brenda Addie as Dan and Barbara Taylor, Jeremy Sims as their mischievous son Alex, Deborah Kennedy as Dan's sister Connie Reynolds, Tim Robertson as Dan's brother Jack, Anne Grigg as his wife Sarah, and Michael Caton as neighbourhood friend Bill Anderson. Originally, creator Lynn Bayonas pitched the show as a family-oriented drama; however to help ensure the program's success, Channel Nine asked for nude scenes and risqu\u00e9 elements to also be included in the series. Initial publicity for the show focused on the sex angle, and it was for this that Chances was chiefly known.",

    "description": "Compact was a British television soap opera shown by the BBC between 1962 and 1965. The series was created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling, who together went on to devise Crossroads. In contrast to the kitchen sink realism of Coronation Street, Compact was a distinctly middle-class serial, set in the more \"sophisticated\" arena of magazine publishing. An early \"avarice\" soap, it took the viewer into the business workplace, and aligned the professional lives of the characters with more personal storylines. The show was scheduled for broadcast on Tuesdays and Thursdays, thus avoiding a clash with ITV's Coronation Street on Mondays and Wednesdays.\n\nWhen Compact began, the editor was a woman, Joanne Minster, yet it was not long before she was replaced by Ian Harmon, the son of the magazine's owner.\n\nDespite being largely criticised by reviewers, Compact was popular with the general public, and in 1964 a regular omnibus edition was introduced, broadcast on Sundays. Morris Barry, a some-time actor and BBC director \u2013 he directed several Doctor Who stories in the 1960s \u2013 took over as producer and was given a brief to spice the series up in view of the criticism it had received from the national press. But the BBC, never comfortable with the concept of soap opera, quietly dropped the series in 1965.",

Most telenovelas run for an average of six to eight months; the shortest ones run about four months, and the longest up to a year. Many \"Mundo de Juguete\" fans believe that either all or some of the tapes and film from the telenovela were lost when Televisa collapsed during the 1985 earthquake. Televisa has been secretive regarding which tapes were lost during that earthquake, so there is no way of confirming this. However, such claims can be disputed, considering that the Telenovela has been repeated on television several times after 1985. During the nineties, it was repeated on Mexico City Canal 9. For a period of time, it was also shown on Unicable or on Telenovelas Televisa remade the telenovela in 2000, and called it \"Carita de Angel\".",

The series aired at 4:15 p.m. EST, between Golden Windows and Concerning Miss Marlowe. Although the show had a strong fan following, at the time NBC had little use for developing any of their daytime shows and canceled First Love after a year and a half. Many cast members such as Patricia Barry, Val Dufour and Rosemary Prinz went on to become long-running daytime stars.\n\nCreated by Adrian Samish and written by Manya Starr, the series centered around jet engineer Zach James and his difficult marriage to Laurie James. Due to being neglected as a child, Zach was obsessed with building a name for himself. Laurie tried to understand him but was unable to help him deal with his problems, as he went on trial for the murder of an aviatrix he may have been having an affair with.\n\nThe show became known chiefly for a major blooper early in its run. A Friday cliffhanger involved Zach seeing his friend Chris crash his plane. Zach ran to tell Chris' wife Amy, \"Chris cracked up the plane.\" In his rush, Dufour blurted out, \"Chris crapped\", then abruptly added, \"...on the plane.\" Patricia Barry began to giggle. When the camera cut to a \"bereaved\" Prinz, she was shaking with laughter. Supposedly NBC nearly fired all three actors, but changed their minds after fans wrote in praising them for the scene. In 2003 Prinz denied such a scene ever made it to the air.",

Armando is a very incompetent playboy with a scheme to turn a huge profit as the new President of Eco Moda, a famous clothing manufacturing company, but his scheme is doomed because of his faulty mathematics. Because Betty, his secretary (and economics wizard), is in love with him, she helps Armando deceive the Board of Directors as he loses money and brings the company to ruin.\n\nBetty, la Fea is arguably the most successful telenovela of all time and one of the most popular television shows in the world. It is the first telenovela to have been remade worldwide and has been regarded as bringing the telenovela to new levels of success.",

Anast\u00e1cia \"Nan\u00e1\" Passos, Duda's friend and mentor, loves him platonically, and rivalizes with Mariza Borges over him. Alex by contrast is a yuppie. He and their mother Morgana have a love-hate relationship and rivalry with his brother over Morgana's attention and the company. Alex begins to love Duda, however she falls in love with Lucas, a graffiti artist who is on the run from the S\u00e3o Paulo police due to his involvement in a crime there. He is also searching for his real father, and thinks it's either Alex or Gaspar.",

    "description": "Hand aufs Herz is a German television soap opera and premiered on October 4, 2010 on the private broadcasting station Sat.1. It got canceled in June 2011, announcing the series finale for September 5, 2011. However that changed when Sat.1 decided to drop the show from its line-up and sixx was announced to air the remaining episodes; with a one-hour series finale on September 2, 2011.\n\nThe show focuses around a fictional high school in Cologne and tackles with young love, a marriage crisis, a mysterious disappearance, schemes and competition fights, coming out, drug abuse, career chances and forbidden feelings. Hand aufs Herz also introduces something completely new to the genre of a soap opera by including music and dance as one of the main elements.\n\nIt has been compared to the successful American television show a hit TV show, Glee and the High School Musical franchise. Even though it started out as a musical series, the show shifts its stories from that plot even though it remains a part of the series.\n\nHand aufs Herz started two weeks after the failed daily drama Eine wie keine aired its final episode due to low ratings. The show is in direct competition with the long-running soap opera Verbotene Liebe and is starring with Vanessa Jung and Andreas Jancke two of its former stars.",

The first attempt to find this happiness is made by trying to enter a bar in the village, \"Las 4 P\", where the locals try to achieve a more cheerful life, along with music, liquor, singing, the dances and \"the women of the consolations\". This is the name with which Amanda began to call the profession of the two women, Sara and Calzones, who were the ones who offered her some protection upon arrival in such an unknown place.\n\nThe need for money to protect her sisters and make them stay by her side and the desperation of not being able to get the means to do so lead Amanda to accept this kind of life to achieve it. However, on the day of her initiation, where she will be known under the nickname \"Wild Flower\", fate will lead her to become a woman of one man: \"The wife of Don Rafael Urrieta\"; a powerful and cruel man who keeps his wife, Catalina, locked in his farm in inhumane conditions for having been unfaithful.

When the insemination is finally done and the young woman chosen - the young Viviane - becomes pregnant, the man discovers himself hopelessly in love with her. From then on an unusual and surprising situation will give an electrifying direction to the story: the boy's spirit begins to prowl the family and, although they are in different plans, father and son will dispute the love of the same woman. It will be a clash between the impossible love, therefore idealized, and the realizable love, carnal, with all that it brings of joy and fulfillment, but also of hurts and uncertainties.",

    "description": "A man takes revenge on behalf of his handicapped sister by seducing the only daughter of the man who injured his sister.\n\nPetch is an engineer that Namneung falls in love with ever since she was still in high school. She is very happy when Petch tells her that he loves her and asks her to marry him, but Namneung's parents (father-Kriengsak, mother-Daranee) don't agree because they have a different social status. Phak (Namneung's friend) is very sad because he secretly loves her and does not pay attention to other women, but Alice loves him.\n\nEven though Numneung's parents don't agree, they get married and Petch takes Numnueng to his house. There, Nam Neung meets Taptim (Petch's mother) & Ploy (Petch's sister). They seem unfriendly and cold to her, especially Ploy. Ploy looks as if she hates Namneung from the first second that they meet. Namneung tries not to pay attention to it because she feels bad for her since Ploy is disabled (lame).\n\nOne day, Ploy brings Rotjana home and tells her that Rotjana is Petch's wife. Namneung is shocked and very sad to know this. Petch tells her that Kriengsak (Namneung's father) had raped Ploy. Her father wanted to hide his fault so he drove his car to hit Ploy and disabled her. He says that Daranee (Namneung's mother) hired a man to attack Ploy. Petch says he has never loved Namneung. He has done everything just to convince her that he loves her. He only wants revenge with her family for what her parents has done to his sister, but because of the love that Namneung has for him, it gives her the patience to stay there and not run back to Bangkok.\n\nPetch, Ploy, and Taptim hurt Namneung physically and mentally, especially Ploy. Potchanee (Rotjana's sister) is the only one who sympathizes for Namneung because she knows that Petch and Rotjana don't have a real husband & and wife relationship, but she can not tell Namneung because Ploy is her benefactor.\n\nNuan (a maid of Namneung's parents) comes to visit Namneung, but she is shocked when she meets Taptim (because in the past, Nuan brought her baby boy to Taptim to help take care of her baby because she needed to escape a murder case). Nuan is very happy to know that Petch is actually her biological son, but she is shocked to know that Ploy is Taptim's daughter. Nuan knows the truth that Ploy wanted to be Kriengsak's wife, but he rejected her because he is a family man. Ploy was very angry so she intentionally walked into an incoming car and the accident disabled her. Ploy put the blame on Kreingsak and Daranee. Her lies caused Petch and Taptim to misunderstand the situation and causes Namneung to be the one who is the receiver of this revenge.\n\nWhen the truth is disclosed, Petch is very sorry that he had hurt Namneung.",

Monthai's mother is a very protective, stubborn, and wants everything done her way. she loves her husband a lot so she allows him to have mistress but she knows about them. though she does not want Monthai to end up a ladies man like his father so she decided to ask for Vichada's hand in marriage. Vichada who was eaves dropping on the whole conversation was happy and satisfied.\n\nMonthai had this friendly and loving nature in him. a distance relative of his also fell in love with him. her name was Lakana. he was friendly to her but she avoided him. and he wondered why. the truth was that his mother had called her lots of names connected to him. calling her a leech just wanting to mooch off of her family's fortune, ect. Piachat also lived nearby. her grandmother wasn't wealthy. they sold vegetables and other things to survive. she was very found of a tree called Asoke. she spotted one in Monthai's yard and went over to pick some. at the moment that she arrived Vichada and Monthai were sharing a sweet moment as both were informed about their engagement. Monthai really didn't express much feeling towards her. but Piachat made a noise and they looked to see who it was and she tried to run but Monthai caught up to her. Vichada was furious and wanted to slap her but was stopped. Monthai found out what she wanted and allowed her to pick the leaves of the Asoke tree. she came more than once and she took a liking in Monthai's generosity.\n\nPiachat's grandmother had a heart attack when she was almost hit by the Hiranyawat's van. Piachat was left as an orphan. the Hiranyawat's decided to adopt her but not as a daughter but as a worker in their house. but she was given an education. to the people that looked into the family they would think that the Hiranyawat's were people with generosity, but the truth was that the father was a player. he was getting sick of his wife and she couldn't do anything about it. so she came up with the idea to raise Piachat and then when she was grown he can take her as his wife. she wanted this so that her husband can fulfill his hormones at home instead of elsewhere. and so Piachat was raised in the Hiranyawat's home and was given the a new name which is Piachat.\n\none night Monthai was out walking and Lakana also walked by. he went over to her and she looked away and he wanted her to look at him. she refused and they started to struggle as he asked her questions about her being afraid of him and she couldn't hold it in any longer and she hugged Monthai, just as his mother came and she started to beat on Lakana and say cruel things to her. Monthai stopped his mother as Lakana raced to her room. hours later after being so ashamed of Monthai's mother words Lakana killed herself. she slit her throat. Monthai was mad and ashamed that this was caused by his mother and he too blamed her. and so he decided that he would go to Australia to finish his studies.\n\nVichada was upset that he was going but he said he would only be gone four years. she wanted something for him to remember her by so she gave him a picture of her. earlier her sister [Paa] said that her writing was like chicken scratch compared to Piachat. so she had Piachat write the message [for Monthai only, love Vichada] on the back of the picture. Monthai was having a party for his leaving and he also invited Piachat and bought her a dress cause she had nothing to wear.",

Thuwaiwanjak Phuttan, Darika\u2019s best friend, has to go on a business trip for his job. He asked her to look after his condo.

    "description": "One day there was a fire in the hospital so the hospital staff was rushing to take the babies out of the nursery. During the fire Korya accidentally fell into the river next to the hospital and floated all the way to Chiang Mai. She was adopted by the church there. Korya grew up in Chiang Mai until she was about 20 years old.\n\nKorya's grandfather couldn't take her mother's crying and sickness everyday so he hired someone to look for her. He knew that Korya had a necklace and ring that her mother gave to her when she was born. He made a new fake necklace and hired someone to be Korya because he knew that he would never find the real daughter.\n\nIn Chiang Mai, the person who he hired found the real Korya by accident. He told her everything about her wealthy family. Korya didn't want to leave the nuns at the orphanage that she grew up in. Id's father wanted to buy the orphanage in order to build a resort there. Korea decided to ask her mother to help her keep the orphanage alive. Payia is Korya's best friend and enemy as they grew up together and lived with each other for a long time.\n\nShe spied on Korya and asked if she could she live with Korya and her new family. Korya said no because she's coming back but Payia packed her stuff and followed Korya to Bangkok. A storm hit and caused Korya and Payia's cars to crash leaving only both of them alive. Payia is fine but Korya is hurt. Payia was worried about Korya. She help Korya but Payia saw the necklace and decided to hit Korya with a branch. Korya then lost her memories. Id found Korya and took her to the hospital. He doesn't know that she had lost her memories. As soon as she woke up she didn't know nor remembered him. He talk to the doctor, who was his best friend, the doctor said Korya lost her memories and the injury she had wasn't from the car crash. Someone must have hit her head with something hard. Id tricked Korya into thinking that she was his girlfriend so she could be safe.\n\nPayia took the necklace and tricked Korya's mother that she was her long lost daughter. Now Payia became rich and got anything she wanted. Korya couldn't remember anything and Payia doesn't knew that Korya is still alive. She thought she killed her but they meet again at a party the mom throws. Payia doesn't know that Korya lost her memories and decided to choke her at the private party when no one else was around. Payia stopped when she heard Korya say that she lost her memories. She doesn't remember what Id had done to her. Everyone eventually wants to help Korya find her lost memories but Id is unhappy about it because that would mean that Korya realizes she's not Id's girlfriend in real life. Plus Korya's male friend from the orphanage, Chinsanu, secretly likes Korya as well. Korya getting her memories back might mean that she goes back to being with Chinsanu.\n\nAt the party Chinsanu notices Korya because he remembers her voice but he couldn't tell its was Korya because he was blind. After getting eye surgery he wanted to see Korya but he doesn't know that she has lost her memories. He had a strange feeling that Korya looked familiar but he couldn't tell it was Korya because he was blind. So Chinsanu teams up with another female friend to figure out if the Korya now is the same as the Korya from his orphanage or not So he followed Korya and Id to the temple and brought his friend to see if that was Korya. They went to the temple and Id left Korya's ring that is shaped like a star. Id took the ring off of Korya's hand in the hospital beforehand and showed Chinsanu Korya's finger. Id didn't give the ring back because he thought that ring was from Chinsanu and he said Korya had promised Chinsanu when he got eyes surgery she would engage him.\n\nPayia becomes more and more paranoid that someone will find out about her masquerading as the Korya so she plots the death of those who suspect her. On top of that list includes the Grand Aunt, the head servant, her grandfather, and even her own mother. The mystery then becomes who is going to figure out Payia's evil plot to take Korya's wealth and family as well as when Korya will remember her old memories.",

When the 33-year-old Lin Miao first met the 25-year-old Jiao Yang, they formed an immediate dislike for each other. However, they soon established the relationship between boss and employee. Every minute of every day, Lin Miao opens doors for Jiao Yang, the heir-apparent who got the job through no merit of his own and helps the once worthless young executive find his worth. In turn, Jiao Yang starts to see a softer side to Lin Miao.",

His teenage son, Petya, has not spoken to him for a year. Igor tries to restore relations, but gets a hard refusal. To find out what is happening in his son's life and what is the reason for such a deep resentment, Igor sends an 18-year-old spy Lera to him. Lera works at Igor's cabaret as a waitress and is secretly in love with the chef, so she can't refuse him. By chance, both Lerin's best friend Danya and a young dancer Masha are involved in a spy operation. Igor does not yet know that these other people's children will become a real school of life and fatherhood for him. And the children still do not know how fateful this experience of \"cooperation\" with Igor will be.",

But this is the year 1700, the time of dramatic changes in the Russian Empire, the time of reformations carried out by Peter the Great. Young serf Ivan Starshov is head over heels in love with Maria, the daughter of his master. He doesn't want to accept that the young princess is no match for him. \"You gave me wishes, but you do not allow me to satisfy them!\" rages Ivan against God. He asks a priest for help, since God created all people equal. But the priest repeats the proverb. Accept your fate destiny as it is. In despair, Starshov repudiates from faith. Ivan is stubborn; he leaves the village to take possession of his fate. This is how the protagonist gets on the winding road to the true understanding of Love.",

Aurora's sister Jezabel, seeing her happiness, is filled with jealousy which causes her to devise the unthinkable with the intention of destroying her. At the height of her resentment, Jezabel puts Aurora in the hands of a bricklayer nicknamed El Pintas, who rapes her, impregnating her with a son to be named Gabriel. Jezabel's manipulations and lies cause Antonio to abandon Aurora, with Gabriel in her arms, on their wedding day. Blinded by his sexism, Miguel, Aurora's father, snatches her son from her and gives him to Pascual Santos, who raises him with his wife Victoria. Twenty-nine years later, Gabriel is now \u00c1ngel Santos, a humbly educated man, but with the strongest family values. Despite all the years that have passed, Aurora does not lose hope of finding her son Gabriel and discovers that she can love again thanks to Julio C\u00e9sar Rey, a lawyer at Corporativo Campero, where she is president.",

The central characters of the series are Irena Rot and Rok Slak, a charming photographer from the city and a nice carpenter from Dolenjska. Their path to happiness will be anything but easy. In a seemingly idyllic village, suspicious things begin to happen, namely someone incites fires and sows fear in the bones of the villagers and firefighters. It seems that some can't wait to stretch their claws around the necks of romantic couples, but it's the fire that ignites the first sparks of love.",
