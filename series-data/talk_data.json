These issues are discussed with a panel of guests that usually consists of political analysts and sometimes include politicians.\n\nIt also runs in a \"Best of\" format Saturday mornings at 5 AM.",

    "description": "Ellen is an American television sitcom that aired on the ABC network from March 29, 1994 to July 22, 1998, consisting of 109 episodes. The title role of Ellen Morgan, played by stand-up comedian Ellen DeGeneres, was a neurotic bookstore owner in her thirties.\n\nThe series centered on Ellen's dealing with her quirky friends, her family and the problems of daily life. The series is notable for being the first one in which the main character came out as gay, which DeGeneres' character did in the 1997 episode \"Puppy Episode\". This event received a great deal of media exposure, ignited controversy, and prompted ABC to place a parental advisory at the beginning of each episode.\n\nThe series' theme song, \"So Called Friend\" is by Scottish band Texas. A running gag was that each episode had a distinct opening credits sequence, resulting from Ellen's ongoing search for the perfect opening credits.",

    "description": "Soccer AM is a British Saturday-morning football-based comedy/talk show, predominantly based around the Premier League. Originally presented by Jane Hoffen, Gary Stevens and Russ Williams, they lasted just a year before Helen Chamberlain and Tim Lovejoy replaced them, where Lovejoy served for over a decade. He has since been replaced by Andy Goldstein and, more recently, Max Rushden. The show has been aired on Sky Sports 2 each Saturday morning of the football season since 1995 from 7:00am or 9:00am to noon originally and currently between 10:00am and 12:00pm. In early 2009, the 500th episode was broadcast. Although the show is filmed live from 2010 it has been broadcast on a momentary delay due to bad language and/or inappropriate content from certain guests.\n\nThe show's current sponsor is Procter & Gamble through their Head & Shoulders brand. The show was previously sponsored by Frijj, a brand of milkshake, after Dairy Crest signed a \u00a32 million sponsorship deal.\n\nParts of the show have remained since the beginning, whilst new items have been introduced each season. In that respect, it is almost the same every week, the difference being new football footage and comedy skits. Every week sees a new group of celebrity guests, generally featuring at least one footballer who is free on the Saturday, and a mix of musicians, TV personalities, and other sportsmen.",

    "description": "Dinner for Five is a television program in which actor/filmmaker Jon Favreau and a revolving guest list of celebrities eat, drink and talk about life on and off the set and swap stories about projects past and present. The program seats screen legends next to a variety of personalities from film, television, music and comedy, resulting in an unpredictable free-for-all. The program aired on the Independent Film Channel with Favreau the co-Executive Producer with Peter Billingsley.\n\nThe show format is a spontaneous, open forum for people in the entertainment community. The idea, originally conceived by Favreau, originated from a time when he went out to dinner with colleagues on a film location and exchanged filming anecdotes. Favreau said, \"I thought it would be interesting to show people that side of the business\". He did not want to present them in a \"sensationalized way [that] they're presented in the press, but as normal people\". The format featured Favreau and four guests from the entertainment industry in a restaurant with no other diners. They ordered actual food from real menus and were served by authentic waiters. There were no cue cards or previous research on the participants that would have allowed him to orchestrate the conversation and the guests were allowed to talk about whatever they wanted. The show used five cameras with the operators using long lenses so that they could be at least ten feet away from the table and not intrude on the conversation or make the guests self-conscious. The conversations lasted until the film ran out. A 25-minutes episode would be edited from the two-hour dinner.",

Each show opens with interspersed scenes of Milhausen and Cho discussing some sex-related topic with three women and three men respectively. The men and women are then brought together for a group discussion, followed by role-playing or trivia games at the end. Field reporter Roy Roman interviews people on the streets of Miami about the same topic, which typically include oral sex, masturbation, fetishes, orgasm, pornography, and the like. The show includes explicit language and discussion not seen on American television and is distinguished from other sex-related television series in that it is primarily designed to convey the opinions and experiences of average people and not to convey expert advice.",

Winfrey used the show as a platform to teach and inspire, providing viewers with a positive, spiritually uplifting experience by featuring book clubs, compelling interviews, self-improvement segments, and philanthropic forays into world events. The show gained credibility by not trying to profit off the products it endorsed; it had no licensing agreement with retailers when products were promoted, nor did the show make any money from endorsing books for its book club.\n\nOprah is one of the longest-running daytime television talk shows in history. The show received 47 Daytime Emmy Awards before Winfrey decided to stop submitting it for consideration in 2000.",

It is named after the song \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" by ABBA, which was used as the show's title music.\n\nSteve Coogan played the incompetent but self-satisfied Norwich-based host, Alan Partridge. Alan was a spin-off character from the spoof radio show On the Hour. Knowing Me Knowing You was written by Coogan, Armando Iannucci and Patrick Marber, with contributions from the regular supporting cast of Doon Mackichan, Rebecca Front and David Schneider, who played Alan's weekly guests. Steve Brown provided the show's music and arrangements, and also appeared as Glen Ponder, the man in charge of the house band.\n\nThe show was a parody of a chat show. It featured a live audience whose laughter meant that viewers could not mistake the show for a real chat show. Alan went on to appear in two series of the sitcom I'm Alan Partridge, following his life after both his marriage and TV career come to an end.",

During the 1952-1953 season, NBC rotated with other variety shows in a Sunday night block known as \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\" (Sept. 1950 to Dec. 1955). Also known as, \"The Chevy Show with Bob Hope.\" When the first special debuted in October of 1950 it was the most expensive television program made up to that point - costing an astronomical $1,500 a minute to produce. Bob Hope had his own television show and radio show at the same time. For the next three seasons, The Bob Hope Show was broadcast once a month on Tuesday nights, giving Milton Berle a week off. Bob ended his radio show in April, 1956. Bob Hope also had another show by a similar name, \"The Bob Hope Show (All Star Revue)\". In addition, he performed in \"Specials\" for many years. It is the longest running variety program in television's history with a record of 45 years of televised entertainment.",

    "description": "Grandstand was a British television sport programme. Broadcast between 1958 and 2007, it was one of the BBC's longest running sports shows, alongside BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Its first presenter was Peter Dimmock. There were only four main presenters of the programme during its long history: David Coleman, Frank Bough, Des Lynam, and Steve Rider. Changes in the structure of the programme during its last few years, however, meant it did not have a regular main presenter during this time. Among the more occasional hosts were Alan Weeks, David Icke, Clare Balding, Hazel Irvine, Bob Wilson, David Vine, Barry Davies, Dougie Donnelly, Harry Carpenter, Harry Gration, John Inverdale, Tony Gubba, Helen Rollason, Ray Stubbs and Sue Barker. The last editions of Grandstand were broadcast over the weekend of 27\u201328 January 2007.",

    "description": "Today is a daily American morning television show that airs on NBC. The program debuted on January 14, 1952. It was the first of its genre on American television and in the world, and is the fifth-longest running American television series. Originally a two-hour program on weekdays, it expanded to Sundays in 1987 and Saturdays in 1992. The weekday broadcast expanded to three hours in 2000, and to four hours in 2007.\n\nToday's dominance was virtually unchallenged by the other networks until the late 1980s, when it was overtaken by ABC's Good Morning America. Today retook the Nielsen ratings lead the week of December 11, 1995, and held onto that position for 852 consecutive weeks until the week of April 9, 2012, when it was beaten by Good Morning America yet again. In 2002, Today was ranked #17 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest Television  Shows of All Time.",

Lee is the creator and executive producer, as well as lead editor and webmaster of SidewalksTV.com. On-air personalities Cindy Rhodes and Rafael Siegel are also co-producers.\n\nDuring the first six years, the show was known as Sidewalks. The producers decided to add Entertainment to the program's title, so viewers would understand it was an entertainment show and not a show related to public works or about concrete walkways. On websites and television grids, the program is listed as Sidewalks Entertainment, although hosts, guests and on-air graphics may still refer to the program as Sidewalks.\n\nAs of April 14, 2007, the show has produced 256 regular editions, along with a number of special episodes and temporary shows.",

Wright drew inspiration from his experiences of being interrogated by the Gestapo during World War II.\n\nThe atmosphere is helped by Mastermind's famously ominous theme music, \"Approaching Menace\" by the British composer Neil Richardson. The quiz programme originated and was recorded in Manchester at studios such as New Broadcasting House and Granada Studios, before permanently moving to MediaCityUK in 2011.",

Intended as an on-going series, the show only received one pilot episode and aired on WPIX channel 11 in New York City and 88 markets around the country, to good Nielsen ratings.\n\nGraffiti Rock resembled a hip hop version of the popular television dance shows at the time such as Soul Train and American Bandstand. The show was created and hosted by Michael Holman, who was the manager of the popular break-dancing crew, the New York City Breakers.\n\nThe episode features Run D.M.C., Shannon, The New York City Breakers, DJ Jimmie Jazz and Kool Moe Dee and Special K of the Treacherous Three. The New York City Breakers, who were fresh off of their success from the movie, Beat Street, made a showcase appearance. The episode also features television and film actress, Debi Mazar and actor/director Vincent Gallo as dancers on the show.\n\nA segment of the show was sampled on The Beastie Boys' LP Ill Communication. \"[...] alright, you're scratchin it right now, cut the record back and forth against the needle, back and forth, back and forth, make it scratch, but let me tell you something don't try this at home on your dad's stereo only under hiphop supervision, alright ?\" The show has since become an important 'must-see' for hip-hop enthusiasts, alongside such titles as Wild Style and Beat Street.",

In the series, Baron Cohen plays three unorthodox journalists: faux-streetwise poseur Ali G, Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev, and gay Austrian fashion enthusiast Br\u00fcno Gehard. These characters conduct real interviews with unsuspecting people, many of whom are celebrities, high-ranking government officials, and other well-known figures, during which they are asked absurd and ridiculous questions.",

In its current incarnation it has been hosted by Craig Ferguson since January 2005. It is produced by Worldwide Pants Incorporated, the production company owned by the host of the show that immediately precedes it: Late Show with David Letterman and CBS Television Studios. It originates from CBS Television City and is shot in High Definition, as of August 31, 2009. The program dates to 1995, and has had three permanent hosts.\n\nThe show differs from most of the other extant late-night talk shows in that it has never used a house band nor an in-studio announcer.\n\nOccasionally, the show is split into 15- and 45-minute segments when CBS airs a daily late night highlight show for either The Masters, other PGA Tour events with rights owned by CBS, or tennis' U.S. Open. The show then has a monologue to start, followed by sports highlights, and then the guest segments. Since mid-2007, however, the highlights show has aired first, followed by the full hour of The Late Late Show.",

A second edition of the show was also produced in the early 1990s. The popular series was syndicated internationally in United States, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore for years.\n\nThe humorous aprons also complemented his humour that consisted of spontaneous one-liners spoken with his trademark Cantonese accent or him playing with his food or cookware. That, combined with his energetic personality, endeared him to Canadian viewers. Prior to him preparing his stir fry cuisine, the show usually featured a vignette of Yan travelling to different vacation spots from around the world. He always invited an audience member to come up and eat with him near the end of each episode, and had a fortune cookie reading before the meal.",

Although Talk Soup poked fun at the talk shows, it also advertised the topics and guests of upcoming broadcasts of them. Despite this several talk shows including The Oprah Winfrey Show refused to allow clips of their shows to be shown on the series. During its run, Talk Soup was nominated for five Daytime Emmy Awards, winning once in 1995 for Outstanding Special Class Program. It remains the only E! show to ever win an Emmy.\n\nA show based on it, The Soup, now airs weekly on E!.\n\nThe show frequently poked fun at actors Randolph Mantooth and Mario Van Peebles. Also featured was a womanizing Argentine sock puppet named Se\u00f1or Sock that had bought several Thighmasters because he was madly in love with Suzanne Somers.",

The show was produced through the facilities of WMAQ-TV in Chicago, and aired exclusively on stations owned and operated by NBC.\n\nThis program was originally known as iVillage Live, which premiered on December 4, 2006 with virtually the same format. iVillage Live emanated from Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, with Miami-based NBC station WTVJ responsible for the program's production. The show also aired on a one-day delay on Bravo when it launched, but the repeats ended on Bravo after three weeks. On September 4, 2007, NBC Universal Television and iVillage.com officially announced the relaunch of IVillage Live as In the Loop with iVillage.\n\nAt its initial launch, iVillage Live was hosted by Molly Pesce, Stefani \"Sissy\" Schaeffer, and Guy Yovan, and featured contributions from Naamua Delaney and Bob Oschack. All five relatively unknown hosts were removed from the program when it was relaunched.",

In January 2010, NBC announced that due to affiliate concerns about its effect on their newscasts, The Jay Leno Show would be shortened to 30 minutes and moved from primetime to 11:35 p.m., the timeslot that had been occupied by The Tonight Show for nearly 60 years.\n\nThe Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien released a public statement saying that he would not participate in moving Tonight to 12:05 a.m., asserting that it would damage the highly respected franchise. Despite much support for O'Brien from both the public and media professionals alike NBC maintained its plan to move Leno to 11:35. On January 21, 2010, NBC reached a $45 million settlement with O'Brien in order to end his contract. Leno resumed his duties as host of Tonight on March 1, 2010. Leno ended on February 9, 2010 after being on the air for only four months, with Entertainment Weekly calling the program television's \"Biggest Bomb of All Time.\"",

The hour-long show premiered on March 2, 2009, and is hosted by actor, comedian and performer Jimmy Fallon, an alumnus of Saturday Night Live. Hip hop/neo soul band The Roots serve as the show's house band, and Steve Higgins is the show's announcer.\n\nThe third incarnation of the Late Night franchise originated by David Letterman, the program originates from NBC Studio 6B in the GE Building at 30 Rockefeller Center in New York City. The show typically opens with a brief monologue from Fallon, followed by a comedy \"desk piece,\" as well as prerecorded segments and audience competitions. The next segment is devoted to a celebrity interview, with guests ranging from actors and musicians to media personalities and political figures. The show then closes with either a musical or comedy performance. The show frequently employs digital media into its comedy, which has become crucial to its success. Fallon has been appointed to become the next host of The Tonight Show, where he will succeed the current host Jay Leno at the conclusion of the 2014 Winter Olympics, with fellow SNL alum Seth Meyers slated to replace Fallon.",

It generally aired on the first Saturday of each month at 7:30PM, each show running 45 minutes. 133 shows were produced. The show was hosted by German actor and comedian Ilja Richter. Its lesser known predecessor on ZDF, 4-3-2-1 Hot & Sweet was aired between 1966 and 1970, presenters included Ilja Richter and Suzanne Doucet. Disco generally served a younger pop-oriented audience compared to ZDF's Hitparade, and until 1972, its main competitor was Beat-Club, followed by Musikladen, both on ARD.\n\nRepeats of Disco have been aired since 1984 on ZDF Musikkanal, after its closedown in 1989 on 3sat. Since 2004, the digital ZDF Theaterkanal aired repeats of the entire series. In 2007, ZDF Dokukanal began to air reruns, starting with episodes from 1975 and also multiple repeats of the series have been shown on hit24 in 2008.\n\nThe show focussed on chart hits current at the time of airing, giving about equal airtime to international pop music and German Schlager. Despite its name, it did not particularly focus on disco music although it featured many disco hits as long as they were chart relevant..",

A stations produced their own similar morning shows under the name A Morning, although due to budget cuts, many of them have been canceled as of 2009.\n\nBT tends to be more relaxed and spontaneous than American morning shows.

    "description": "\"The Dini Petty Show,\" a Canadian daytime TV talk show aired from 1989 to 1999 on Baton Broadcasting System-affiliated stations, originating from Toronto's CFTO-TV, the BBS flagship station. Hosted by Dini Petty, it combined lifestyle features and interviews with celebrities. Petty, a Toronto-based host, moved from CITY-TV's CityLine to lead the show. Directed by Randy Gulliver, it captured 1990s Canadian pop culture with diverse interviews, undergoing redevelopment in late 1994. By 1999, Petty opted to film only intro/outro segments, airing repackaged retrospective content instead of new material. In 2000, Dini Petty's contract with CTV concluded, prompting a legal resolution that granted her ownership of the original broadcast tapes from The Dini Petty Show. Her decision to donate these tapes to the Clara Thomas Archives & Special Collections at York University occurred in 2010.",

It was hosted by Thierry Ardisson and produced by Catherine Barma.\n\nDuring its first season, the show took the form of societal debates; it was in September 1999 that it was re-formatted into a talk-show.\n\nThe show features guests who are making news at the moment, including actors, writers, singers, politicians and athletes. Guests discuss their life and engage in thematic interviews. The show gradually acquired a provocative reputation, notably since the host does not hesitate to ask political guests questions about their private and sexual lives.\n\nWith Thierry Ardisson as the main host, he was first accompanied by Laurent Ruquier and Linda Hardy. Later, he turned to duos \u00c9ric and Ramzy, then Kad and Olivier. Finally, he opted for comedian Lauren Baffie as co-host, until the end of the show.",

According to Griffin, the reality shows, even the \"scandal-plagued\" Temptation Island, \"amazingly\" contributed clips to be mocked. The show premiered on MTV February 4, 2001, and ended on April 1, 2001 after only six episodes; MTV did not renew the show, due to low ratings. USA Today columnist Whitney Matheson wrote that the show \"seemed to be struggling for content,\" and \"all the good jokes are taken by the time Kathy's weekly rant sees airtime.\"",

In 2006 Stegelmann received a new prize called the Nordic Game prize, and was promised that the prize should be named after him from that day on, because of his \"contribution to the coverage of computer games on Danish national television and his understanding of the relevance of the phenomenon of games to the entertainment culture\", referring to Troldspejlet, the film magazine Planet X, and his many books about films, video games, and comics. Troldspejlet has been shown on Danish television channel DR1 since 1989, and uses the Gremlins 2 End Credits theme from the American horror-comedy film Gremlins 2 as signature tune. Primarily, the target group is children and adolescents.",

It aired from 6 May 2002 to 26 December 2003. It featured celebrities who chatted with Graham and became involved in studio games which were usually laden with sexual innuendo. The studio games were later featured on the clip show Nortonland in 2007 on digital channel Challenge.\n\nThe show featured a 'webcam', a roving television camera which was randomly situated in a different place in the UK each week and which followed Graham's instructions and allowed him to interact with the public live. The feature was made technically possible using digital microwave link technology provided by Rear Window Television with the 'spontaneous' webcam feature always produced as a full quality Outside Broadcast, before being made to look like a traditional webcam at the studios.",

It aired late Sunday night and was originally hosted by Neil Mercer.\n\nIn October 1996, the show moved to Sunday mornings and began screening live at 8.30 am, up against Network Ten's Meet the Press and the second half of Nine Network's Business Sunday. Guests were interviewed live in the studio, instead of pre-recording.\n\nIn 1997, Stan Grant became the host until mid year when Chris Bath took over. In 1998, Bath moved to Witness and Glenn Milne took over.\n\nIn 1999 it became a segment of Sunday Sunrise and ceased to be a stand-alone programme. During that year the segments changed from being live with Glenn Milne to being a Friday night pre-record by Stan Grant.",

The program's host, Conan O'Brien, previously hosted NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien, which followed The Tonight Show with Jay Leno for 16 years, until O'Brien's brief succession over Leno.\n\nMany members of the Late Night cast and crew made the transition to The Tonight Show. The Max Weinberg 7, the house band from O'Brien's Late Night, served as the house band under the new name, Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band. Andy Richter returned to the show as announcer, and also began resuming his role as sidekick, shortly before the show's conclusion. The opening and closing theme song from Late Night was also carried over to Tonight, in a slightly altered form.\n\nIn January 2010, after the show had been on the air for seven months, it was announced that NBC was intending to move Jay Leno from primetime back to his original timeslot at 11:35 pm, with O'Brien's show starting shortly after midnight. In response to the announcement, O'Brien released a press statement saying that he would not continue as host of The Tonight Show if it was moved to any time after midnight to accommodate The Jay Leno Show. He feared it would ruin the long and rich tradition of The Tonight Show. It had been on after the late local newscasts from the beginning. After two weeks of negotiations, NBC announced that they had paid $45 million to buy out O'Brien's contract, ending both his tenure as host as well as his relationship with NBC after 22 years.",

It ran from August 2, 2004 to August 3, 2006.\n\nHosted by Sarah Kuttner, it was a more youthful variation on the traditional late show concept with a sidekick, Sven Schuhmacher, and various national as well as international celebrity guests. The show also featured humorous reports by Michael Wigge and Caroline Korneli, its own band and musical guests performing live on stage.\n\nWhen MTV took over other German music channel VIVA in 2004, it was suggested, the show would be cancelled, which drew massive protests from fans. It was then cut from four shows per week to just two shows and later transferred to MTV and renamed Kuttner. Production was relocated from Cologne to Berlin.\n\nMTV cancelled Kuttner. in summer 2006 due to low ratings and high production costs.",

    "description": "This VPRO's \u2018summer classic\u2019 is based on an equally simple and refreshing idea that originated in 1988: When during the summer most of the channels are showing reruns, ask interesting people people to curate their \u2018favorite television evening\u2019 and let them clarify the fragments in a long-form interview/conversation.\n\nThe programme was first aired in 1988. Each episode takes up an entire Sunday evening, lasting typically three hours. It consists of an in-depth studio interview with a notable Dutch, Belgian or other Dutch-speaking foreigner, interspersed with cinema or television footage selected by the guest, which is subsequently discussed. Guests include writers, scientists, television personalities, politicians or business people.",

The series aired on Rogers Television 22, a community channel in Ottawa, Ontario, until 1996, when it was picked up by The Comedy Network. The second season began airing on December 4, 1998. (In 1996, Tom Green also produced a pilot episode for CBC Television, although the CBC did not pick up the series.)\n\nIn January 1999, the show moved to the United States and aired on MTV. The series stopped production in March 2000, due to Green's diagnosis of testicular cancer, but continued to appear on the channel via reruns and other promotional materials. In 2002, it was ranked #41 on TV Guide's 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time. In 2003, the show was revived as The New Tom Green Show. In 2006, Green launched Tom Green Live, a live call-in show for his website, which was later renamed Tom Green's House Tonight.",

These compelling stories embody the spectrum of the human experience -- the miracle of birth, the romance of weddings and triumphs over adversity.

The series transcends the boundaries of age, race and religion by telling stories from an array of perspectives as diverse and individual as the women themselves...from a 75 year-old grandmother who fulfills her lifelong dream of graduating from college, to the once homeless youth who overcame adversity to attend Harvard Divinity School. Life Moments - Stories of Hope, stories of Triumph, stories of Inspiration for and about women. Make every moment count.",

    "description": "Skavlan is a Norwegian-Swedish television talk show hosted by Norwegian journalist Fredrik Skavlan. It premiered in Sweden on Sveriges Television in January 2009, and the first guests to appear on the show were former Prime Minister of Sweden G\u00f6ran Persson and his wife Anitra Steen. On 8 May 2009, it was announced that Skavlan had been renewed for a second season. It was also announced that the show would no longer only be produced by SVT in Sweden; Skavlan would now be partly produced in Norway by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. The first twelve episodes of Skavlan's second season were produced by SVT in Sweden, and the remaining twelve by NRK in Norway.\n\nSkavlan speaks Norwegian and his dialog is therefore subtitled in Swedish in Sweden, even though the two languages are quite similar and mutually intelligible. If the persons being interviewed by Skavlan are Swedish, he often tells them to let him know if they do not understand what he is saying. Swedish novelist Jan Guillou has criticized SVT for subtitling the program, stating \"there is no need for that. If the host had been Danish, subtitling would have been necessary, but with a Norwegian host it does not make any sense.\"",

The Revolution intends to fire up emotion in the hearts of its viewers with everyday modern family experiences and testimonies fueled by the Bible itself.",

    "description": "Face to Face is a Philippine reality tabloid talk show aired on TV5 and hosted by Amy Perez. It is produced exclusively by ABC Development Corporation and bills itself as a \"Barangay Hall On-Air.\"\n\nIt is very similar to the US television show The Jerry Springer Show but has a Filipino cultural perspective, predominantly with \"marginalized and impoverished guests\". The show aims to resolve minor conflicts between two arguing parties with the help of a panel of counselors that represent the legal, emotional and spiritual aspects of living.\n\nThe show is one of the most popular talk shows in the Philippines but has also proved to be controversial due to the violence exhibited in the show. Hence, the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board has requested that the show \"tone down physical altercations between guests\".",

The show became one of Norway's most popular TV productions though it was the center of criticism due to controversial episodes such as B\u00e5rd Tuft Johansens \"Chicken stunt\", involving the then Norwegian Labour Party leader Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland.\n\nAfter the show was taken of the air Harald Eia and B\u00e5rd Tufte Johansen continued to created new successful NRK shows such as Uti v\u00e5r hage, Team Antonsen, Tre br\u00f8dre som ikke er br\u00f8dre, Ut i v\u00e5r hage 2 and Storbynatt.",

His iconic interviews included Malcolm X in 1965, Lenny Bruce in 1966, and the only known interview with Bruce Lee in 1971.\n\nWhen CTV launched, a Pierre Berton show quickly followed, aiming to compete with CBC's late-night news. Initially on CTV, it later shifted to CHCH Hamilton due to scheduling conflicts, continuing its acclaimed interviews syndicated by Screen Gems. Despite its brief CTV run, it relocated to Hamilton after CTV adjusted its lineup to rival CBC's 11:00 PM news.",

    "description": "Koffietijd! is een Nederlands livetelevisieprogramma dat van 1994 tot 2001 werd uitgezonden op RTL 4. Het dagelijkse televisiemagazine, uitgezonden tussen 10.00 en 11.00 uur 's ochtends, werd gepresenteerd door het duo Mireille Bekooij en Hans van Willigenburg. Onder het motto hoe drinkt de koffiegast zijn of haar koffie? was bekend en onbekend Nederland te gast in het veelbekeken praatprogramma.\n\nIn het seizoen 2000/2001 worden, als gevolg van een verjongingsdrift, zowel de bekende klassieke Koffietijd!-tune als Bekooij en Van Willigenburg in de rol van presentator vervangen door Sybrand Niessen en Judith de Klijn. In navolging op de verjongingsdrift vallen de kijkcijfers erg tegen en wordt er besloten te stoppen met het programma. In 2006, 2007 en 2008 zijn er wel nog eenmalige speciale afleveringen te zien om de kijkers aan te moedigen geld in te zamelen voor het goede doel.\n\nVanaf 5 april 2010 is Koffietijd als vanouds weer doordeweeks te zien op RTL 4. Ditmaal met in de presentatie Loretta Schrijver, Quinty Trustfull en Pernille La Lau. Vanaf 25 februari 2012 is het programma ook te zien op de zaterdag. De zaterdaguitzending heeft inmiddels meerdere formats achter zich liggen: een reguliere liveuitzending met uitgaan als onderwerp, een weekcompilatie en presentatrice Loretta die gasten interviewd in de openlucht op telkens een andere locatie of een bepaalde uitgaanstip op locatie laat zien.",

Some dismal summers result, filled with injuries, malfunctioning equipment and constant fighting among the greenhorn miners, yet serious cases of gold fever always trump any talk of giving up and sometimes leads to dreams being salvaged. The companion series `The Dirt' presents the inside scoop on behind-the-scenes relationships between such miners as brash youngster Parker Schnabel and longtime Yukon resident Tony Beets, as the quest to hit the mother lode never stops.",

Taped in Los Angeles, the non-traditional set for Kocktails with Khlo\u00e9 is designed to replicate a true, intimate home environment; as such, it will feature a functional kitchen, dining area and living spaces \u2013 but it will not include a studio audience. In each episode, celebrity guests \u2013 including Khlo\u00e9's friends and family \u2013 will join her in the kitchen and around the table for a lively dinner party where engaging and relevant conversations will pair with cooking, party games and, of course, Kocktails. Adding to the elegant and fun party atmosphere will be Chef Sharone Hakman who will collaborate on menus and assist in entertaining.",

With local ingredients and the limited number of items the members are allowed to bring from Korea, they\u2019re requested to make tasty Korean food that lives up to the host\u2019s expectations. What makes Miss Korea more entertaining is that the eight members are divided into two teams and compete with each other. Each team leader can choose whom they want to work with, and the others must win the team leaders\u2019 hearts with their secret items. Some of the cast has knowledge and experience of cooking whereas some may not be familiar with cooking. Under these conditions, will they be able to make the dish and satisfy the host?

A socially needy family can qualify for participation by winning the always same outside bet, in order to make their private fate public in front of a running camera and in the presence of passengers in the moving subway. Childlike rounds of games give them the opportunity to improve social welfare, critically watched by a jury made up of the handicapped actors from Schlingensief's ensemble. Aged show stars like Maria and Margot Hellwig, Christian Anders or Roberto Blanco are used in a talk-show wagon as cheap fodder and  are forced to show compassion with such victims of the market economy. The bands of the MTV generation (Atari Teenage Riot, Surrogat, S\u00f6hne Mannheims and others) play in the dance wagon.",

Talk is not a humorous TNT show in the usual sense. It has no rules or clear rules, rounds and scoring, winners and losers. This is an honest, open conversation of four modern guys on life topics - childhood and parents, sex and relationships, work and success, the army and school. There is no introduction or greetings, the show immediately connects the viewer to the rather intimate and informal conversation of the four comedians. These are conversations that are familiar to everyone in a variety of situations. You've heard or led them in the bar after work, in bed before bed, at the therapist's, in the kitchen, on the train. The time has come to talk about this on television with the same intonation.",

An actor wears a costume with an oversize head to portray her, while the broadcasts show her face in 3D computer graphics, which allows for a variety of outrageous expressions and effects. Accompanied by comedian Takashi Okamura, the show features Chico-chan asking Okamura and others simple questions, such as \"Why do people wave their hands when they say goodbye?\" If they cannot answer properly, she spits out her sarcastic signature phrase, \"Botto ikiten ja ne-yo!\" (Don't sleep through life!) Yuichi Kimura provides the voice of Chico-chan.",

    "description": "Chris Russo has never been afraid to bring the heat as a radio host. Nicknamed \"Mad Dog,\" he shows real passion for sports when the subject is baseball. Hearing him rant on satellite radio is one thing; seeing him is electrifying, which is why MLB Network collared Mad Dog to talk hardball each weekday. The hourlong studio show begins with Russo's monologue on the day's big headlines, then accelerates to league news with a roster of contributors including analysts Al Leiter, Dan Plesac, Harold Reynolds, Bill Ripken, insider Tom Verducci, and national/local beat writers and broadcasters.",

A ranking of music videos by popularity and relied on fans sending their votes by mail. At the end of the 1980s, unrest broke out in Algeria which led the country into a Black Decade. At this time, fundamentalist groups attempted to ban music and most other forms of artistic expression. The show continued to air despite death threats, but on February 14, 1994, Aziz Smati was shot in both legs by a young extremist, which ultimately led to the end of the show .",

It\u2019s an unrealistic expectation in a town with no stars, a show with no budget, an inexperienced writing staff, Dave\u2019s ego and TJ\u2019s naivet\u00e9.\n\nThe band rocks, the local guests are quirky and fun, the director is an absolute boss, the producer is motivated, the announcer might be a murderer, but despite all that going for it, it\u2019s shocking how little can be accomplished when everyone is working as hard as they can in separate directions.",

Prepared using a National Science Foundation grant, the series is designed to explain to the viewer some of the basic facts about viruses, those structures so essential to life and health, facts which for the most part have only been discovered in the past twenty-five years. Drawing on advanced scientific techniques such as microcinematography, electron microscopy and freeze drying, as well as on animation, large-scale models and drawings, the programs combine lectures with demonstrations to give the viewer an extremely vivid picture of this complicated topic. Particularly emphasized are facts about the virus' relation to bacterial disease, to polio, and to cancer, and new information about viruses which may not yet be generally known to students of biology or to the non-scientific public.",
