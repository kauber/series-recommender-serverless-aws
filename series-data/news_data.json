    "description": "Hardball with Chris Matthews is an American television talk show on MSNBC, broadcast weekdays at 7 PM ET hosted by Chris Matthews. It originally aired on now-defunct America's Talking and later CNBC. The current title was derived from a book Matthews wrote in 1988, Hardball: How Politics Is Played Told by One Who Knows the Game. Hardball is a talking-head style cable news show where the moderator advances opinions on a wide range of topics, focusing primarily on current political issues. These issues are discussed with a panel of guests that usually consists of political analysts and sometimes include politicians.\n\nIt also runs in a \"Best of\" format Saturday mornings at 5 AM.",

    "description": "Countdown with Keith Olbermann was an hour-long weeknight news and political commentary program hosted by Keith Olbermann that aired on MSNBC from 2003-2011 and Current TV from 2011-2012. The show presented five selected news stories of the day, with commentary by Olbermann and interviews of guests. At the start of Countdown, Olbermann told television columnist Lisa de Moraes:\n\n\"Our charge for the immediate future is to stay out of the way of the news.... News is the news. We will not be screwing around with it.... As times improve and the war [in Iraq] ends we will begin to introduce more and more elements familiar to my style.\"\n\nThe show was known for Olbermann's fast-paced rhetoric, historical and pop culture references, and liberal commentary. Olbermann melded news stories, both serious and light, with commentary, much of it critical of Republicans and conservative politics. The show has been the source of controversy due to these criticisms, as well as the host's ongoing commentary against Fox News and his feud with its leading primetime personality, Bill O'Reilly.\n\nDuring the January 21, 2011, edition of Countdown, Olbermann announced that it would be his last appearance on the show, but gave no explanation why. The New York Times reported the following day that Olbermann had negotiated his exit from MSNBC, with a secret deal. After being hired by Current TV, Olbermann announced on April 26, 2011, that his nightly news program on the new network would begin June 20, 2011, and would also be called Countdown with Keith Olbermann. On March 30, 2012, Current TV terminated its relationship with Olbermann and replaced his show with a program hosted by Eliot Spitzer.",

Broadcast on ABC1 in Australia, it premiered on 19 August 1961 and celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2021. Founding producer Robert Raymond and his successor Allan Ashbolt did much to set the ongoing tone of the program.\n\nBased on the Panorama concept, the program addresses a single issue in depth each week, showing either a locally produced program or a relevant documentary from overseas. The program has won many awards for investigative journalism, and broken many high-profile stories. A notable early example of this was the show's epoch-making 1962 expos\u00e9 on the appalling living conditions endured by many Aboriginal Australians living in rural New South Wales.",

It is the only early morning network newscast on any of the Big Three television networks that is not produced jointly with an overnight news program.\n\nThe program is broadcast live at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and is transmitted in a continuous half-hour tape delayed loop until 10:00 a.m. ET, when Today begins in the Pacific Time Zone. The program usually airs as a lead-in to local morning newscasts on most NBC stations, although in the few markets where the NBC station does not produce a morning newscast, it may air in a two- to three-hour loop immediately before the start of Today. The show is updated for any breaking news occurring before 7:00 a.m. ET, while stations throughout the network will join Today in all time zones past that time at their local discretion or network orders for live coverage.",

    "description": "Today is a daily American morning television show that airs on NBC. The program debuted on January 14, 1952. It was the first of its genre on American television and in the world, and is the fifth-longest running American television series. Originally a two-hour program on weekdays, it expanded to Sundays in 1987 and Saturdays in 1992. The weekday broadcast expanded to three hours in 2000, and to four hours in 2007.\n\nToday's dominance was virtually unchallenged by the other networks until the late 1980s, when it was overtaken by ABC's Good Morning America. Today retook the Nielsen ratings lead the week of December 11, 1995, and held onto that position for 852 consecutive weeks until the week of April 9, 2012, when it was beaten by Good Morning America yet again. In 2002, Today was ranked #17 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest Television  Shows of All Time.",

The New Zealand version of the show has also featured segments of the Australian version.\n\nGerald Stone, the founding executive producer, was given the job by Kerry Packer and was told: \"I don't give a f... what it takes. Just do it and get it right.\" After the first episode was broadcast on 11 February 1979, Packer was less than impressed, telling Stone: \"You've blown it, son. You better fix it fast.\" Over the years, Stone's award winning 60 Minutes revolutionised Australian current affairs reporting and enhanced the careers of Ray Martin, Ian Leslie, George Negus, and later Jana Wendt.\n\nSince it was first broadcast, 60 Minutes has won five Silver Logies, one Special Achievement Logie, and received nominations for a further six Logie awards.",

    "description": "Cold Pizza was a television sports morning talk show that aired weekdays on ESPN2. The show's style was more akin to Good Morning America than SportsCenter's straight news and highlights format. It included daily sports news, interviews with sports journalists, athletes, and personalities, and an assortment of other sports and non-sports topics. This show began airing on October 20, 2003. The show's launch team and daily production management was led by broadcast executives James Cohen, Joseph Maar and Todd Mason. Although Cold Pizza was simulcast on ESPN2HD, it was not produced or presented in high definition. On October 2, 2006, DirecTV became the presenting sponsor with the show titled as Cold Pizza presented by DirecTV.\n\nTwo back-to-back two-hour episodes aired each weekday from Monday through Friday, with the live episode airing from 10 a.m. ET until noon, followed by a repeat at 12 p.m. ET. The show was hosted by former SportsCenter personality, Dana Jacobson, who joined the program in 2005, and Jay Crawford, who was with the show for its entire run. Skip Bayless contributed during the \"1st and 10\" segments. Woody Paige, who had been his antagonist during those segments, left after the November 28, 2006, episode, citing health and personal reasons, leaving New York to return to the Denver Post, where he had been a longtime writer.",

The program's name derives from the \"20/20\" measurement of visual acuity.\n\nThe hour-long program has been a staple on Friday evenings for much of the time since it moved to that timeslot from Thursdays in September 1987, though special editions of the program occasionally air on other nights.",

    "description": "Movie Surfers is a Disney Channel mini-show, that appears in commercial-like form, where teenagers go behind the scenes of Walt Disney-related films. It started out as a TV special that would air when a new Disney movie came out. It was about teenagers communicating with each other via webcams and getting info about the movies. Now, it also appears as 5-minute segments after a Disney Channel movie or series ends.\n\nIn 1997 when the show began, Mischa, Lindsay, Alexis, and Marcus used the computer to surf the internet to go behind the scenes of upcoming movies. Starting in 2002, they began sitting in a screening room and talking to various actors and actresses of the movie and what inspired the movie. Since early 2005, there's been a brand new cast: Rose, who left early 2006 and was replaced by Stevanna, Josh, Jeryn, and Tessa. They still sit in a screening room but have branched out to do more interactive segments in which they might get to actually get in on some of the filming process themselves.\n\nIn 2009, Disney XD started airing Movie Surfers. sometimes during commercial breaks.",

Its campaigning journalism frequently had a major impact on events of the day. Its production teams often took audacious risks and gained a solid reputation for its often unorthodox, some said left-wing, approach.\n\nCabinet ministers fell victim to its probings. Numerous innocent victims of the British criminal justice system, including the Birmingham Six, were released from jail. Honouring the programme in its fiftieth anniversary awards, the Political Studies Association, said: \"World in Action thrived on unveiling corruption and highlighting underhand dealings. World in Action came to be seen as hard-hitting investigative journalism at its best.\"\n\nIn its heyday World in Action drew audiences of up to 23 million in Britain alone, equivalent to almost half the population.",

The series was colourful in both its creative use of subject matter, and its use of bright colours that helped accent the action on screen rather than distract from it. Subjects were separated by eye catches that often featured the artwork of Junko Mizuno. Ross hosted each episode in suits so bright and stylised they could have been stolen from an anime character.\n\nFans have credited the series for the care that both Ross and the BBC have placed in its production. Time was given to delve into each subject, and he was able to interview various figureheads of culture and industry, including Mamoru Oshii, Hayao Miyazaki, Takeshi Kitano, Takashi Miike with Takashi Murakami and Sonny Chiba.\n\nThe theme song of the show was Kiyoshi no zundoko bushi by Kiyoshi Hikawa.",

    "description": "The Glass House was a half-hour Australian comedy talk show which screened on the ABC from 2001 to 2006.\n\nIt was hosted by stand-up comedian Wil Anderson, and co-hosted by fellow television and radio comedians Corinne Grant and Dave Hughes. Two additional guests joined the regular cast each week, including musicians, politicians, actors, radio personalities and other celebrities of varying calibre, such as Young Australian of the Year winners and Olympic athletes. Regular guests included comedians Adam Spencer and Akmal Saleh, netballer Liz Ellis, Play School host Rhys Muldoon, musician Pinky Beecroft, and music critic Molly Meldrum. The show thrived on taking regular shots at, among others, Shannon Noll, Amanda Vanstone, Naomi Robson, Shane Warne and Peter Costello. The format of the programme is similar to that of the BBC series, Have I Got News for You.\n\nThe show was pre-recorded in front of a live audience in the ABC's Sydney studio on Tuesday evenings. During the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the show was taped inside the Melbourne Town Hall. The program initially screened on Friday nights, but suffered from an inconsistent timeslot, resulting in humorous TV spots, for example 9:30 Friday...probably. In 2005, The Glass House shifted to a more reliable timeslot on Wednesday at 9:35pm.",

The show jump cut between its various spoof TV channels, which covered both the central story and other stories that would be of interest to their audience. A large part of the comedy came from observations about the nature of news presentation rather than the stories themselves.",

In addition, viewers were supposed to be able to communicate with each other live on the air. However, this function was never available, even though in the original promo for the show, it showed the capability. The show was produced by Room 403 Productions.\n\nThe show premiered on September 23 with that was then the lowest ratings in the network's history, which could be blamed on the program being in one of the network's worst time slots and the network's lax promotion of the series. Only 994,000 viewers caught the premiere of the show.\n\nOn October 17, 2007, The CW canceled Online Nation, making it the second show to be canceled in the 2007-2008 television season.\n\nThe comedic duo who hosted the show, Rhett and Link, responded quickly to the cancellation with an internet video.",

The Saturday edition aired live from 7 to 9 a.m. Eastern Time as well, but a number of affiliates did not carry it or aired it later on tape-delay. It premiered on November 1, 1999, and was the newest of the major networks' morning shows, although CBS has made several attempts to program in the morning slot since 1954. The show aired as a division of CBS News.\n\nThe Early Show, like many of its predecessors, traditionally ran last in the ratings to its rivals, NBC's Today and ABC's Good Morning America. Much like NBC's The Today Show and The Tonight Show, the title The Early Show was analogous to that of CBS's late-night talk show, The Late Show.\n\nOn November 15, 2011, CBS announced that a new morning show would replace The Early Show on January 9, 2012. CBS News chairman Jeff Fager and CBS News president David Rhodes stated that the new show would \"redefine the morning television landscape.\" On December 1, it was announced that the new show would be titled CBS This Morning. The Early Show ended its twelve-year run on January 6, 2012, to make way for the program. Charlie Rose, Gayle King, and Erica Hill were named anchors of the new program.",

    "description": "The Colbert Report is an American satirical late night television program that airs Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. It stars political humorist Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The Colbert Report is a spin-off from and counterpart to The Daily Show that comments on politics and the media in a similar way. It satirizes conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, particularly Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor. The show focuses on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\", is a caricature of televised political pundits.\n\nThe Colbert Report has been nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards each in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, two Television Critics Association Awards Awards, and two Satellite Awards. In 2013, it won two Emmys. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, including by the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust and by Robert Wexler following his interview on the program. The Report received considerable media coverage following its debut on October 17, 2005, for Colbert's coining of the term \"truthiness\", which dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster named its 2006 Word of the Year.",

Fronted by Sir Trevor McDonald and in a similar style to the BBC One programme Have I Got News for You, its format featured three comedians and McDonald satirising the week's news. Marcus Brigstocke was a permanent member of the \"news team\".\n\nNews Knight is produced by Hat Trick Productions, the same production company as Have I Got News For You. The programme's title is a pun on McDonald's knighthood and on the BBC Two current affairs programme Newsnight. The show is therefore referred to as \"News Knight with Sir Trevor McDonald\" to avoid confusion.",

Produced by Creative Differences, the program explores potential catastrophic threats to individual cities, countries, and the entire globe.\n\nThe two \"mega-disasters\" of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 inspired the series and provided a reference point for many of the episodes. Excepting only two shows devoted to man-made disasters, the threats explored can be divided into three general categories: meteorological, geological, and cosmic hazards.",

The programme was, up until mid-2007, produced by the Corporation's New Media and Digital Services division in Brisbane. It was shown weekdays on the digital-only channel ABC2 at 4.00pm, 7.00pm, and 7.30am, and can also be viewed at ABC Online.\n\nThe program follows a daily theme covering a range of topics and issues. Earth Works, shown on Mondays, focusses on the 'real world' and environment, Gen Next, shown on Tuesdays concentrates on the interests and issues of young people, especially those in rural areas. On Wednesdays the five winners of the 2005 \"Video Lives\" competition present video diaries of their lives and communities, while on Thursdays Arts About showcases the artistic talents and endeavours of Australians living in rural and regional areas. Outta Here on Fridays follows sport and recreational activities.\n\nContent for the program comes from a number of sources, including reports from state and territory ABC News bulletins, reports from programs on the Australia Network, and ABC Local Radio presenters. Over summer, Australia Wide Summertime screens 10 minutes of news and weather and replaces the second section with short documentaries from a variety of sources, shown only on ABC2.",

The show focuses on making \"ultimate\" versions of popular or common dishes.\n\nThe show began as a secondary show for host Tyler Florence who was still making episodes of his original show, Food 911. At the time of its conception, Food Network became very active in creating traveling food shows. Tyler's Ultimate was unique in the regard that the host himself usually cooked on the program in addition to traveling. The original format of the show featured Tyler focusing on a particular dish for each episode. He would travel around the world to discover different versions of that dish, as well as its origins, in an attempt to discover the ultimate version of that dish. At the end of the episode, Florence would combine the recipes he learned through his travels and adding his own spin to create \"the ultimate recipe,\" though some episodes simply had him eating the dish, not preparing it at all.\n\nThe show's format has changed; the traveling is removed as well as where the inspiration of the ultimate recipe came from, and Florence simply presents his version for the entire program, typically with more side dishes.",

Its name in Italian translates as \"the news slithers\", a probable parody of the slighting Italian journalist, submitted to politicians and overwhelmed with shame. The polysemic term Striscia, in English strip, can recall both a line of cocaine and the comic strip. But Striscia is also the slithing snake: this show worm in the hidden holes to unmask the television cheats. Founded in 1988, it is meant to be a parody of the daily news, which airs right before the program, but Striscia also satirizes government corruption and exposes scams with the help of local reporters who are also comedians. The program is directed and produced by Antonio Ricci and is hosted by two major comedians. Usually Ezio Greggio is assisted by another comedian for the winter season, after which there is a change of guard.",

In January 1993 NBC green-lit a pilot episode which took three months to complete. Interest from the BBC prompted NBC to insert the show into its summer 1994 lineup.",

The second series covered a broader range of issues in depth. This included election coverage and documentary footage from several U.S. states, among them Florida, Texas, Illinois, D.C. and Nevada. In addition, among its pop-culture coverage, the Journal reported on the 25th anniversary of the premiere of the long-running NBC talk program The Tonight Show. Like the first installment, the second one was produced by WNET in New York City, and was aired on PBS. However, the second installment and consequently the series ended in 1981.\n\nFor the third time, Bill Moyers Journal returned to television on April 25, 2007. The debut episode was \"Buying The War\", which demonstrated how the commercial U.S. media served as an unwitting partner to the Bush administration in convincing the American people that the Iraq War was legitimate and necessary.",

A stations produced their own similar morning shows under the name A Morning, although due to budget cuts, many of them have been canceled as of 2009.\n\nBT tends to be more relaxed and spontaneous than American morning shows. Unlike American morning shows, it does not have pre-taped segments that are focused on current events or socio-political issues. The guests tend to be more human interest, informational, and promotional in nature and there is less of a focus on celebrities.",

    "description": "The Camel News Caravan was a 15-minute American television news program aired by NBC News from February 14, 1949, to October 26, 1956. Sponsored by the Camel cigarette brand and anchored by John Cameron Swayze, it was the first NBC news program to use NBC filmed news stories rather than movie newsreels. On February 16, 1954, the Camel News Caravan became the first news program broadcast in color, making use of 16mm color film. In early 1955, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, maker of Camel cigarettes, cut back its sponsorship to three days a week. Chrysler's Plymouth division sponsored the other days, and on those days, the program was labelled the Plymouth News Caravan. The program featured a young Washington correspondent named David Brinkley, and competed against Douglas Edwards with the News on rival CBS. With greater resources, the News Caravan attracted a larger audience than its CBS competition until 1955.\n\nLaunched on February 16, 1948, by NBC as NBC Television Newsreel, and later Camel Newsreel Theatre it began as a 10-minute program that featured Fox Movietone News newsreels. John Cameron Swayze provided voice-over for the series. The Camel News Caravan was an expanded version of the Camel Newsreel Theatre feature Swayze on-camera.",

The show was revived for its second run when the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike caused many of Network Ten's imported US programmes to cease production.\n\nGood News Week drew its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organisations, and often, aspects of the show itself. The show opened with a monologue by McDermott relating to recent headlines, after which two teams of three panellists competed in recurring segments to gain points.\n\nThe show has spawned three short-lived spin-off series, the ABC's Good News Weekend, Ten's GNW Night Lite and Ten's skit-based Good News World.",

The programme is currently initially broadcast on CBC Television at 7:00 p.m. local time.\n\nAs The Hour, the show was so named, as it was a daily one hour program. For the show's seventh season, the show was renamed and shortened into a daily half-hour show, George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight, beginning September 20, 2010. In September 2011, the program was again extended to one hour with its current name. It returned to a half-hour for the 2012-13 season and moved to 7:00 p.m., along with a late-night encore that moved to 11:30 p.m. due to the expansion of late local news at several of the CBC's major market stations.\n\nThe show's opening theme song is \"The Good in Everyone\" by Canadian rock band Sloan. It replaced the formerly used track, \"Use It\" from The New Pornographers at the start of the 2008 broadcast season.",

The series producer was Mickie Most, who was inspired to make the programme after he saw an interview with Top of the Pops' producer Robin Nash, in which he boasted that TOTP was a music programme that the whole family could enjoy together. Most set out to make a show which was the antithesis of that, and which featured live music performances most closely related to the then emergent Punk rock and New Wave music scenes - though it also included other more mainstream artists such as Kate Bush, Dire Straits and Lindisfarne.\n\nThe official host of the programme was Chris Hill, but it is remembered more for the contributions of Peter Cook. Cook played the manager of the fictional ballroom where the show was supposedly taking place, and frequently made disparaging remarks about the acts appearing.",

The programme was the first breakfast programme for Channel 4, broadcasting between 06:00 and 09:25 each weekday morning. The first edition of the programme was broadcast on 3 April 1989, with the last edition being broadcast on 25 September 1992.\n\nConceived as a television newspaper, output was based heavily on news and current affairs. Also, a number of bite-sized feature segments lasting between 5 and 10 minutes were slotted around the news output and were shown several times each day. These included a business programme, Business Daily - which had been on air as a lunchtime programme since October 1987 - sporting discussion, lifestyles, arts and entertainment, Countdown Masters - an abbreviated version of Countdown - and a cartoon slot called Comic Book.\n\nThe Channel Four Daily failed to gain enough viewers and the last broadcast was shown on Friday, 25 September 1992. It was replaced with the relatively more popular programme, The Big Breakfast from Monday, 28 September 1992.",

Fight Girls is produced by Scott Messick and Tom Weber.\n\nSimilar in spirit to Spike TV's The Ultimate Fighter, ten female fighters live together and train with a Muay Thai instructor in Las Vegas for six weeks in an effort to fight for a Muay Thai championship in Thailand.

The losing fighter is eliminated from the house and the winner will go to Thailand at the end of the season. The theme song for Fight Girls is \"Fingerprints\" by Katy Perry.",

    "description": "How's Your News? is an American television series and also a feature film. It aired Sundays on MTV in the United States, and the feature film based on the same concept was released in 2003. It stars a group of reporters with developmental disabilities who interview celebrities and politicians. It is the continuation of a documentary film project started in 1999 by Arthur Bradford at Camp Jabberwocky in Martha's Vineyard, which was made into a movie of the same name and shown on HBO in 2003. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone serve as the show's executive producers. Season One had a total of 6 episodes.\n\nAccording to the \"How's Your News?\" website on April 9, 2009, the show has not been renewed for a second season on MTV, stating:\n\n\"The decision had little to do with the quality of the series, which was one of the most enthusiastically received and best reviewed programs on mtv this year. It\u2019s just a tough financial time and mtv needed to keep pushing for higher ratings with other shows. Also, we always knew that our series was an unusual fit for their style of programming. We\u2019re not \u201cThe Hills\u201d or \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Best Dance Crew\u201d after all\u2026\"\n\nAfter completing the feature film for HBO, the concept was pitched to the Trio network, who subsequently backed the short film \"On the Campaign Trail\", about the How's Your News? teams trip to both the Democratic and Republican conventions in 2004. The half hour film was broadcast on Trio and Channel Four England and featured candid interviews with Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Andre 3000, Ben Affleck, Howard Dean, Michael Moore and Newt Gingrich, amongst others. Although it was rarely seen, this half hour documentary was well reviewed and helped convince MTV of the viability of the concept as mainstream TV series. They funded a pilot in 2006.",

    "description": "Weekend was a television newsmagazine that ran on NBC from 1974 to 1979. It was originally aired once monthly on Saturday nights from 11:30 P.M. to 1 A.M. Eastern time, the same time slot as Saturday repeats of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson during its first season, then to replace Saturday Night Live, once a month on those weekends when the SNL cast was not producing a show. The program was awarded a George Foster Peabody medal in 1975 and attracted a cult following.\n\nThe program was hosted by Lloyd Dobyns, who also did much of the reporting. The show's creator and executive producer was past president of NBC News, Reuven Frank. Together, Dobyns and Frank were largely responsible for the distinctive writing and quirky style of the program.\n\nIn 1978, after four years of critical success and moderately good ratings for that hour, NBC moved Weekend to prime time. After airing once a month in various time slots in September, October, and November, the network placed the program weekly on Saturday nights at 10 P.M. Eastern time starting in December of 1978. Linda Ellerbee was added as Dobyns' co-host and co-lead reporter. Placed against strong programs on ABC and CBS, the show eventually died of poor ratings. A few years later, Ellerbee and Dobyns reunited to anchor another late-night NBC news program, NBC News Overnight.",

It was hosted by Walter Cronkite. The opening and closing theme music was written by composer George Antheil.\n\nThe program presented filmed reports on news and cultural events that were important for the development of the 20th century. The show did not just present the events, but also interpreted them. Such subjects as World War I and major assassinations were presented in context.\n\nOn 20 January 1967, the show was renamed The 21st Century, sponsored by Union Carbide. The show's focus changed to the future, and what mankind could look forward to. 'The 21st Century' was cancelled after three seasons. The reason given was that the writers had run out of things to talk about. However, it is possible that CBS may have wished to replace it with a more commercially successful program.",

    "description": "Saving Planet Earth is a season of nature documentaries with a conservation theme, screened on BBC Television in 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of its specialist factual department, the BBC Natural History Unit.\n\nThe series featured films contributed by a number of celebrities on the plight of various endangered species, and coincided with the launch of the BBC Wildlife Fund, a charitable organisation which distributes money to conservation projects around the world. The television series culminated in a live fundraising telethon on BBC Two, hosted by Alan Titchmarsh, which raised over \u00a31 million for the charity.\n\nThe BBC broadcast a second live telethon in 2010. Wild Night In was presented by Kate Humble, Chris Packham and Martin Hughes-Games and featured conservation projects which had benefited from the support of the BBC Wildlife Fund. This helped to raise a further \u00a31 million.",

The show engaged a varied group of individuals from civil advocates to criminals.\n\nInterviews were conducted with \"The Interrotron\", a device similar to a teleprompter: Errol and his subject each sit facing a camera. The image of each person's face is then projected onto a two-way mirror positioned in front of the lens of the other's camera. Instead of looking at a blank lens, then, both Morris and his subject are looking directly at a human face. Morris believes that the machine encourages monologue in the interview process, while also encouraging the interviewees to \"express themselves to camera\".",

Unlike sound-bite driven reporting, the show\u2019s correspondents conduct interviews with affected peoples and the regions involved usually being led by a guide and translator who facilitates access. Since Vanguard's subject matter often involved expos\u00e9s about organized crime, drug trafficking and armed revolts, the correspondents can face significant danger because of their reporting due to unstable political or security situations.\n\nVanguard has received some of the media industry\u2019s highest honors for journalism, including the 69th Annual Peabody Award, given for excellence in electronic media, and the 2010 Television Academy Honor, which recognizes \"achievements in programming that present issues of concern to our society in a compelling, emotional and insightful way.\" Vanguard has also been awarded the 2009 Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Award and the 2009 Livingston Award and was nominated four times for a news and documentary Emmy and for a sports Emmy\u00ae.",

It was produced in the Rockefeller Center's \"Studio 3B\", the same space as NBC Nightly News, and formerly that of the Today Show.\n\nNamed after the location of the NBC News headquarters in the GE Building at 30 Rockefeller Center, the program was the first new NBC News program to launch in primetime since Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric debuted in 1993.\n\nRock Center was designed to be more serious than NBC's existing prime time newsmagazine, Dateline NBC, which had increasingly delved into human interest and true crime stories, and had switched from a multiple-story format into a single story format.\n\nOn May 10, 2012, NBC announced that Rock Center had been removed from the schedule for the remainder of the May 2012 sweeps period due to low ratings. Three days later, on May 13, 2012, NBC announced that Rock Center would be renewed for a second season during its 2012-13 upfront presentation. The series was also shown on MSNBC.",

It premiered on January 9, 2012, and airs live from 7 to 9 a.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday; most affiliates in the Central and Mountain time zones air the show on tape-delay from 7 to 9 a.m. local time.

It is the tenth distinct program format that CBS has aired in the morning slot since 1954; it replaced The Early Show, which aired from 1999 to 2012.\n\nCBS This Morning, which shares its title with a program that ran from 1987 to 1999, was announced on November 15, 2011 by CBS News management as a \"redefining\" alternative of hard news and analysis. Norah O'Donnell and Gayle King serve as weekday anchors of the program.",

    "description": "\"Il testimone\" (i.e. The witness) is a tv show created, made and presented by Pif.  Every episode consists of a \"mini-reportage\", filmed through a little camera that Pif brings himself. This makes the spectator feel as if most of the tv filtres are removed and thus they can almost witness the events with their own eyes and feel directly involved in the social messages brought on by the show. Themes vary: they go from interviews to famous individuals, to trips, to the work of associations or even small everyday realities.",

Through interviews with Chamberlain, her children, and eyewitnesses today, archival footage and broadcasts, and \u2013 for the first time \u2013 access to Chamberlain's personal archive of family stills, movies, audio recordings, and letters, the series is a compelling universal story that still resonates today.",

Under the executive production of Ross McLean, following the success of similar CBC programs, it attracted up to 60 contributors, aiming to challenge viewers with compelling content. Hosted by John Saywell and Barbara Frum, who honed her interviewing style here, it featured Patrick Watson, Warren Davis, Percy Saltzman, Ken Lefolii, Peter Desbarats, and Moses Znaimer. Segment producers like Perry Rosemond and Peter Herrndorf worked on the show, which covered diverse topics via studio interviews, music, commentary, panels, and documentaries. While not pushing controversy, it contributed to national dialogue. Notable productions included documentaries on airline safety and Vietnam, setting a serious tone for its era. Its influence extended to later CBC shows like the fifth estate and The Journal.",

Following former Met Police DCI Colin Sutton and his team, this investigation examines the historic cold case of the \u2018Bunny Girl\u2019 murders, uncovering a key link between the murders of Eve Stratford, Lynda Farrow and the seemingly unconnected case of murdered schoolgirl Lynne Weedon, revealing the pattern of a potential serial killer gone unnoticed for decades in the process. With this new revelation, can Sutton and his team finally bring justice and close the book on a 40-year-old case once and for all?",
